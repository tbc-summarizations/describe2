  <h1>Description for image-9.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my roast of these fools:

•   <strong>happymanofficial:</strong> More like sad-excuse-for-a-human-official. You think throwing "!bigcode sex" around is edgy? Newsflash, it's just pathetic. And "liar"? Projecting much?
•   <strong>henrythekazakh:</strong> Dude, screaming for rights after spamming "!bigcode hi" and begging for rights yourself? Get a grip. Your profile pic looks like a cheap emo album cover from 2005.
•   <strong>soulalt:</strong> The only thing more irritating than policing "bigcode" usage is your condescending "dish kid" attitude. Get off your high horse and realize nobody cares about your precious resources. HTML page? Wow, so impressive.
•   <strong>adammady:</strong> "KID..." Yeah, because you're probably some basement-dwelling neckbeard trying to sound profound. Go back to your anime figurines.

In short, this entire chat is a cesspool of cringe. Bravo, everyone. You've successfully made the internet a worse place.</div>
