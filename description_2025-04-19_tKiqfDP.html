  <div class="discord-text">In this video game clip, the player stands in a dimly lit control room with consoles labeled "MAIN CONTROL RISER" and alerts indicating the "DARK MATTER REACTOR IS CURRENTLY OFFLINE". An announcement warns personnel to exit the core chamber as the reactor core ignition sequence is primed. The player activates a switch, which is immediately followed by an alarm blaring throughout the facility and an explosion behind the player that knocks them to the floor. After getting back up, the player attempts to activate the switch again but is blown off their feet again by another explosion.</div>
