  <h1>Description for BattleForNiggas3.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay here's my ranking of the characters from worst to best, no punches pulled:

<strong>Worst to Best</strong>

1.  <strong>Black Hole (J):</strong> The edginess of an empty void doesn't land well. No personality, just a void of humor.

2.  <strong>Goblin (B):</strong> Boring. Lacks uniqueness or interesting qualities.

3.  <strong>Coconut Elephant (K):</strong> Overused and uninteresting.

4.  <strong>Cow From Minecraft (C):</strong> Mildly amusing as a meme, but not much beyond that.

5.  <strong>Aldi (A):</strong> Slightly better. The Aldi logo is recognizable, but doesn't have depth or personality.

6.  <strong>Stop Breathing (E):</strong> Slightly better than Aldi, but not by much.

7.  <strong>Evil Venus (J):</strong> Has edge, but is just cringe.

8.  <strong>Face (K):</strong> I like that he's just happy.

9.  <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin (G):</strong> The absurdity of the edits is what makes this interesting.

10. <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed (D):</strong> Good concept.

11. <strong>This Fucking Cat (H):</strong> The cat's expression is priceless. The cat is the best because of it's expression and how he wants to be a gentleman

12. <strong>Kanye West (I):</strong> Kanye is the best out of the group. He is not like those other dweebs

13. <strong>Al Gore:</strong> Al Gore is ok, just pretty boring.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is entirely my personal ranking, with no objective criteria.</div>
