  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not pulling any punches in this comparison of Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Here's the lowdown on 20 key aspects, and my unvarnished opinion on which nation comes out on top:

<strong>1. Geography:</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> Vast, primarily flat steppe with mountains in the east and southeast, and deserts to the south. Access to the Caspian Sea.
