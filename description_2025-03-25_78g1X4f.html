  <h1>Description for five_nights_at_peru.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text"><strong>Setting:</strong> A dimly lit, virtual tavern within the depths of the Google Play Store listing for "Five Nights at Peru."

<strong>Characters:</strong>

•   <strong>Ricardo:</strong> The slick-haired profile picture, perpetually sporting sunglasses indoors. Arrogant and thinks he's cooler than he actually is.
•   <strong>Clicky (Clickteam USA LLC):</strong> A nervous, sweating button, constantly aware of the download count.
•   <strong>Adolescentes (T-Rating Icon):</strong> A rebellious teenager, chewing gum loudly.
•   <strong>Descarga (Download Icon):</strong> Always trying to fill their quota of downloads
•   <strong>Dory (Fishbowl):</strong> An easily-distracted goldfish.

<strong>(Scene opens with Ricardo lounging against the bar, Download Icon pacing nervously, Adolescentes slouched in a booth, and Clicky desperately polishing the counter.)</strong>

<strong>Ricardo:</strong> (smirking) Five Nights at Peru, still trending. I told you guys, my mug is gold. Gold, I tell you!

<strong>Clicky:</strong> (wringing its hands) Ricardo, please! Don't jinx it! Every night, I lose thousands of downloads! People say it's too expensive.

<strong>Adolescentes:</strong> (blowing a bubble) Yeah, 59 bucks? I could buy like, ten bags of chips with that.

<strong>Descarga:</strong> "We only get 104MB to show what is being offered."

<strong>Ricardo:</strong> Chips are for peasants. My face sells the experience! The danger! The... authentic Peruvian vibe?

<strong>Clicky:</strong> Authenticity? We just put a bunch of stock photos and some cheap jumpscares! I'm going to lose my job at USA LLC if this doesn't pick up.

<strong>Adolescentes:</strong> (eyes the fishbowl) Hey, Dory! Wanna hear about existential dread?

<strong>Dory:</strong> (blinking) Bubbles!

<strong>Clicky:</strong> Stop distracting him, Adolescentes! This is serious.

<strong>Ricardo:</strong> (flexing) Relax, Clicky. With my star power, "Five Nights at Peru" will be the next big thing! I mean, people love me, don't they? Just look at my 4.9 stars

<strong>Descarga:</strong> "I don't know, with a price of $59.00 and with no hype. Our downloads are dwindling."

<strong>Adolescentes:</strong> (scoffs) Four point nine? Probably paid for those reviews.

<strong>Ricardo:</strong> (grumbling) You wound me, Adolescentes. Wounded!

<strong>Dory:</strong> (swimming in circles) Where did the bubbles go?

<strong>Clicky:</strong> (sobbing) Five Nights at Peru. More like Five Minutes of Irrelevance.

<strong>(Ricardo puffs out his chest and tries to strike a heroic pose, but a notification pops up – "One star review: 'This game is overpriced garbage!'" Ricardo's face falls.)</strong>

<strong>Ricardo:</strong> (whispering) Maybe I should take off the sunglasses...

<strong>Descarga:</strong> "Or lower the price!"

<strong>(All eyes turn to Descarga. Cut to black.)</strong></div>
