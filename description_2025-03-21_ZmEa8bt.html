  <h1>Description for edited_image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest roast of Justin Bieber based on this mugshot:

Justin, you look like a toddler who just got caught drawing on the walls with a marker. That "facial hair" is doing absolutely nothing for you. It's like a sad attempt at rebellion that failed miserably. And those "dimples" look like someone just poked holes in your cheeks with a pen. Maybe focus less on getting arrested and more on growing a real beard, kid. You look ridiculous.</div>
