  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Everton squad with absolutely no filter:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Coach: David Moyes 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 7/10. Nostalgia merchant. His peak was a decade ago. Might bring some stability, but not the cutting-edge tactical brilliance needed.

•   <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>
•   Asmir Begovic 🇧🇦: 3/10. Washed. Purely a backup, and not even a particularly inspiring one.
•   Jordan Pickford 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 6/10. Prone to errors and moments of madness. Overrated because he plays for England.
•   Joao Virginia 🇵🇹: 2/10. Not good enough.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>
•   Ashley Young 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 2/10. Embarrassing. Should be playing in League One, not the Prem.
•   Seamus Coleman 🇮🇪: 5/10. Club legend, but legs are gone. Sentimentality doesn't win games.
•   Jake O'Brien 🇮🇪: 4/10. Likely Championship-level at best.
•   James Tarkowski 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 6/10. Decent, old-school defender. But lacks pace and can get exposed.
•   Michael Keane 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 3/10. A liability. Consistently makes costly mistakes.
•   Jarrad Branthwaite 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 7/10. Promising young talent. Could be a future star if he leaves Everton to a proper club.
•   Tyler Onyango 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 1/10. Not cut out for the Premier League. A waste of space.
•   Vitaliy Mykolenko 🇺🇦: 6/10. A solid, unspectacular player.
•   Nathan Patterson 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: 5/10. Shows glimpses, but inconsistent.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   Idrissa Gana Gueye 🇸🇳: 5/10. Past his prime. Can still tackle, but offers little else.
•   Orel Mangala 🇧🇪: 6/10. A fairly adequate midfielder who is never too noticeable.
•   James Garner 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 7/10. Decent player who could play for a top club.
•   Tim Iroegbunam 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 4/10. One for the future, perhaps. Not ready for consistent Premier League action.
•   Abdoulaye Doucoure 🇲🇱: 4/10. Extremely inconsistent.
•   Dwight McNeil 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 7/10. Creates lots of chances but has minimal end product.
•   Youssef Chermiti 🇵🇹: 3/10. Average player.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>
•   Jack Harrison 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 6/10. A decent winger, but far from a game-changer.
•   Jesper Lindstrøm 🇩🇰: 6/10. Mediocre player at best.
•   Carlos Alcaraz 🇦🇷: 5/10. Not good enough for premier league football.
•   Iliman Ndiaye 🇸🇳: 7/10. Everton's most prolific player.
•   Dominic Calvert-Lewin 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 4/10. Forever injured and when he does play, he's a shadow of his former self.
•   Armando Broja 🇦🇱: 5/10. Raw talent, but needs serious development.
•   Beto 🇬🇼: 4/10. A donkey.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

<strong>4/10.</strong> This is a relegation-threatened squad, plain and simple. A collection of average players, past-their-prime veterans, and unproven youngsters. Lacks genuine quality and leadership. Moyes has his work cut out for him just to keep them up.</div>
