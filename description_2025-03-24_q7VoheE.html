  <h1>Description for IMG_8770.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Aight, bruv, let's have a look at this ting, yeah? On my life, it's peak London.

We got two Arriva buses, styll, repping West Croydon. One's a double-decker, the 154, LG23 EZL. "I am an electric bus," it says, all calm and cold. The other's a single-decker, the 166, LXII AWJ. Both looking dry, ready to tap in and roll out.

Behind 'em, we got some proper London buildings, innit? Glass towers and a church with the spires looking all tapped. The sky's looking cold, blue as you like.

Big man ting, this is pure London vibes, fam. Say no more, wallahi. I can't lie, it's a wet day in the city, but these buses are keeping it real. I'll be so real, mums life, this pic is calm. Say nothing. Straight up g.</div>
