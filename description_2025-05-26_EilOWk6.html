  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercup, because here's the UCL Matchday 5 roast, served extra crispy:

•   <strong>Sparta Prague 0 - Atlético Madrid 6:</strong> Sparta Prague? More like Sparta pathetic. Getting walloped by Atlético is less of a football match and more of a public flogging. Should probably stick to local beers and not the Champions League.

•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava 2 - Milan 3:</strong> Slovan Bratislava, congrats on almost doing something. Almost. Milan barely broke a sweat. A for effort I guess?

•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen 5 - Red Bull Salzburg 0:</strong> Bayer Leverkusen utterly dismantled Red Bull Salzburg. Maybe instead of energy drinks, Salzburg should try consuming some actual talent. They got slaughtered.

•   <strong>Young Boys 1 - Atalanta 6:</strong> Young Boys? More like Young Victims. Atalanta ran a train on them. This match was an embarrassment.

•   <strong>Barcelona 3 - Brest 0:</strong> Barcelona beating Brest? Yawn. Tell me something I don't know. Probably a really boring match, not a shock.

•   <strong>Bayern Munich 1 - Paris Saint-Germain 0:</strong> Bayern winning 1-0 against PSG just shows what overrated and uninspired team is PSG, and what old and boring tactics does Bayern uses.

•   <strong>Inter Milan 1 - RB Leipzig 0:</strong> Inter squeaking out a win against Leipzig? Must have been as thrilling as watching paint dry. Both teams need a serious injection of creativity.

•   <strong>Manchester City 3 - Feyenoord 3:</strong> Manchester City, drawing 3-3 with Feyenoord? Pathetic. This is why they will never achieve much. Feyenoord, good job, but you were up against a mediocre opponent.

•   <strong>Sporting CP 1 - Arsenal 5:</strong> Sporting got mauled by Arsenal. Guess they forgot their lion tamer. Atrocious performance, embarrassing their fans. Arsenal is decent though, no surprise.

•   <strong>Red Star Belgrade 5 - VfB Stuttgart 1:</strong> Red Star Belgrade destroying Stuttgart? What year is it? Thought Stuttgart was better than that, but apparently not. Embarrassing.

•   <strong>Sturm Graz 1 - Girona 0:</strong> Sturm Graz beating Girona? Okay, who wrote this script? Must have been the most boring game in history.

•   <strong>Monaco 2 - Benfica 3:</strong> Monaco almost cooked it, losing to Benfica.

•   <strong>Aston Villa 0 - Juventus 0:</strong> Aston Villa drawing 0-0 with Juventus? Great way to waste 2 hours of our lives.

•   <strong>Bologna 1 - Lille 2:</strong> Bologna losing to Lille? Guess they need to trade their pasta for some goals. Who cares about this match anyway?

•   <strong>Celtic 1 - Club Brugge 1:</strong> Celtic drawing with Club Brugge? That sounds about right for a team that peaks in the group stages and then disappears.

•   <strong>Dinamo Zagreb 0 - Borussia Dortmund 3:</strong> Dinamo Zagreb getting shut out by Dortmund? They're basically just UCL filler at this point. Dortmund should have scored more.

•   <strong>Liverpool 2 - Real Madrid 0:</strong> Liverpool beating Real Madrid. A surprise, but not really. They are so inconsistent that they can pull of anything, but that doesn't make them good.

•   <strong>PSV Eindhoven 3 - Shakhtar Donetsk 2:</strong> PSV barely beating Shakhtar Donetsk. Probably one of the worst Champions League matches in history.</div>
