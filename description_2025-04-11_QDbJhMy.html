  <h1>Description for IMG_9871.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because your uncle's TikTok Live needs some serious help. Here's a brutally honest assessment:

•   <strong>Lighting is atrocious:</strong> Is he trying to film in a haunted house? The lighting is so bad you can barely see him. Tell him to find a well-lit room or invest in a ring light. This is basic stuff.
•   <strong>Camera angle is awful:</strong> Why is the camera pointed up at his face like that? It's not flattering to anyone. Tell him to raise the camera to eye level.
•   <strong>What's that thing on the wall?:</strong> That looks like a electrical outlet, which means he is in a house, which means he probably has more places to film at.
•   <strong>Overall vibe:</strong> Looks like he's trying to be a quirky grandpa on the internet. Does he even know how to use TikTok? Maybe he should watch some tutorials before embarrassing himself further.
•   <strong>Tiktok Elements:</strong> Who even uses those default elements? They are hideous. Either remove those or try to edit them so they don't look that bad, or better yet, just remove them.

Seriously, your uncle needs to step up his game if he wants to be taken seriously on TikTok. This is not a good look.</div>
