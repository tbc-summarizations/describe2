  <div class="discord-text">Here's a brutally honest evaluation of United Airlines Flight 93 as a contestant in this object show:

<strong>General Information</strong>

United Airlines Flight 93 is an object show contestant based off the real life plane of the same name which was one of the planes involved in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This is a pretty morbid origin for a contestant, and in bad taste. It also makes its presence on the show incredibly controversial, and likely to be voted out before the show progresses for too long.

<strong>External Appearance</strong>

The Plane's appearance is, well, a picture of a United Airlines plane. There's not much to say about the design, as it just resembles what it's supposed to be. The fact that a tragic event is being exploited to have a contestant in an object show is already disrespectful enough, but it makes the plane look even more terrible because there's nothing actually interesting or good to note about it. 

<strong>Personality</strong>

Its personality is just as bad as its appearance, as not even 5 seconds after its first introduction does it blatantly say it's "totally fine" and that "nothing happened to me that tuesday morning". Making a character with an interesting design is one thing, but turning a plane that suffered an extremely tragic fate into an object show character seems to have taken the concept too far.

<strong>Abilities</strong>

Since the plane is never seen in action on the show, its abilities are only implied from its personality, which include being able to dodge certain scenarios, like a bad joke.

<strong>Rating</strong>

Overall, United Airlines Flight 93 gets a 0/10. It doesn't have anything interesting to offer other than its tragic origin, which doesn't make its presence on the show funny, but downright tasteless. Also, it tries to be a little too innocent, making the fact that it has a horrible backstory even worse. Not even the best comedy skit could save this character from its tragic backstory, and the show would have been better off with its presence completely removed.</div>
