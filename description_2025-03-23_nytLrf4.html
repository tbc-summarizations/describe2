  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how that UEFA Euro 2024 qualifier group will shake out, no BS:

1.  <strong>Serbia:</strong> They are the clear favorites in this group. More talent, better organization, and frankly, a superior attitude. Expect them to coast through without much trouble.

2.  <strong>Hungary:</strong> They have a decent squad and some tactical discipline, but lack the killer instinct of Serbia. Will put up a fight, but ultimately fall short of topping the group.

3.  <strong>Montenegro:</strong> A scrappy team with some decent players. Will steal points off the bigger teams, but inconsistent performances will prevent them from seriously challenging for a top-two spot.

4.  <strong>Bulgaria:</strong> They have been on a downward spiral for years. Expect them to be cannon fodder for the rest of the group. They are not a serious threat to anyone.

5.  <strong>Lithuania:</strong> Forget about them. They are just there to make up the numbers. Complete and utter underdogs who will struggle to even score a goal.

In summary, Serbia wins, Hungary second, Montenegro third, Bulgaria fourth, and Lithuania dead last. Don't expect any surprises. This group is pretty predictable.</div>
