  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest breakdown of Astana's 2015-16 Champions League squad, rated at the time:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Branimir Stoilov:</strong> 5/10. Pragmatic and organized defensively, but clearly lacked the tactical flexibility to compete at a higher level. Looked overwhelmed against stronger opponents.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Nenad Erić:</strong> 6/10. A decent shot-stopper, but prone to errors and lacked command of his area.
•   <strong>Mikhail Golubnichi:</strong> 2/10. A complete unknown. Never saw real action.
•   <strong>Vladimir Loginovsky:</strong> 2/10. Another benchwarmer with no real impact.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Eldos Akhmetov:</strong> 3/10. Looked out of his depth at this level. Too slow and defensively weak.
•   <strong>Marin Aničić:</strong> 6/10. The best of a bad bunch. Physically strong, but limited technically.
•   <strong>Abzal Beisebekov:</strong> 4/10. Average, at best. Lacked the quality needed for Champions League football.
•   <strong>Branko Ilić:</strong> 5/10. Past his prime, slow and often caught out of position.
•   <strong>Birzhan Kulbekov:</strong> 2/10. A completely anonymous player.
•   <strong>Igor Pikalkin:</strong> 2/10. Barely registered a presence.
•   <strong>Yevgeny Postnikov:</strong> 4/10. A functional player but nothing special.
•   <strong>Dmitry Shomko:</strong> 5/10. Energetic and willing, but lacked the technical skills to make a real difference.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Denys Dedechko:</strong> 5/10. Solid defensively, but offered little in terms of creativity or passing range.
•   <strong>Foxi Kéthévoama:</strong> 6/10. The only spark in midfield. Showed glimpses of skill but lacked consistency.
•   <strong>Rinat Khairullin:</strong> 3/10. Utterly forgettable.
•   <strong>Nemanja Maksimović:</strong> 7/10. Young and promising, showed composure and passing ability. Definitely one to watch.
•   <strong>Serikzhan Muzhikov:</strong> 4/10. Hardworking but ultimately limited.
•   <strong>Roger Cañas:</strong> 5/10. Physical presence in midfield but clumsy on the ball.
•   <strong>Georgiy Zhukov:</strong> 4/10. Failed to impress.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Bauyrzhan Dzholchiyev:</strong> 4/10. Lacked the quality to trouble Champions League defenses.
•   <strong>Junior Kabananga:</strong> 5/10. Fast and energetic, but lacked the finishing ability to make an impact.
•   <strong>Zhakyp Kozhamberdy:</strong> 2/10. A complete non-factor.
•   <strong>Tanat Nuserbaev:</strong> 4/10. Average.
•   <strong>Aleksey Shchetkin:</strong> 4/10. Mediocre and uninspiring.
•   <strong>Patrick Twumasi:</strong> 6/10. Showed potential with his pace and dribbling, but lacked the consistency to be a real threat.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

<strong>3/10</strong>. This squad was clearly not Champions League caliber. They were defensively organized and hard to break down, but utterly lacking in quality and creativity. They relied heavily on individual moments of brilliance rather than cohesive team play. They did not deserve to be there and the only reason they succeeded in any match was due to luck and pure defensive tactics.</div>
