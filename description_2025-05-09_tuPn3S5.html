  <h1>Description for pMOfXYrCtlc</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here we go. 

The next episode is a big mystery, right? Okay, so that one guy has to figure out how he can go back in time and save everyone who just blew up. But it turns out, he has to team up with ISpeed, which is ridiculous. 

They're in the past, and things are weird. Suddenly, the pigeon with fries has super strength and is threatening to crush everything. Of course, he has to try to avoid the explosions, too. This is going to end with Kazakhstan turning into a super Kazakhstan. He has to fight off this thing that goes by big money. Big money ends up running Kazakhstan through a blender or something, and then everything just resets with "The End, Again?"</div>
