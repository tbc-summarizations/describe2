  <h1>Description for voice-message_3.ogg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the transcription of the audio, translated into English:

"There was this one time, when the black slave was like, 'Bro, I'm done, bro, I'm leaving, I'm leaving!' And I was like, 'Where do you think you're going, you son of a bitch? What do you think you're doing? You won't leave.' Then I went back to, 'Yes, you're a dog! Come here!' As if I was threatening to watch what I would do and the load I'll put in you now, I'll put it in your ass."</div>
