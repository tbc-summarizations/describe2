  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's my brutally honest rating of this XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Gianluigi Donnarumma (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹):</strong> 7/10 - He's a solid keeper, but prone to occasional lapses in concentration. Overrated in my opinion.

â€¢   <strong>Francesco Acerbi (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6/10 - A seasoned veteran, but lacks pace and can be exposed by faster attackers. Past his prime.

â€¢   <strong>Matteo Darmian (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6/10 - Versatile but not exceptional in any area. A decent squad player at best.

â€¢   <strong>Aleksandr Soldatenkov (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 4/10 - Unproven and playing for a Russian team...I wouldn't trust him in a big game.

â€¢   <strong>Leo Skiri Ostigard (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´):</strong> 5/10 - Decent but nothing special.

â€¢   <strong>Lorenzo Pellegrini (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6/10 - Can be creative, but inconsistent and often disappears in crucial moments.

â€¢   <strong>Davide Frattesi (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6/10 - Energetic and hard-working, but lacks the technical quality to be a top midfielder.

â€¢   <strong>Anton Miranchuk (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 5/10 - A technically gifted player who never lived up to his potential.

â€¢   <strong>Daler Kuzyayev (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 5/10 - Average player and nothing special

â€¢   <strong>Stephan El Shaarawy (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹):</strong> 5/10 - A shadow of his former self. Too inconsistent and lacks end product.

â€¢   <strong>Giacomo Raspadori (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹):</strong> 6/10 - Promising but inconsistent. Needs to improve his finishing and decision-making.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>3/10</strong> - This team is a disaster waiting to happen. The defense is slow and shaky, the midfield lacks creativity and steel, and the attack is toothless. They would get destroyed by any top-tier team. The mix of nationalities only makes the chemistry problems even worse. Honestly, this is a team that would struggle against mid-table teams in a decent league.</div>
