  <div class="discord-text">The image shows a series of messages in a chat. "AdamMady" states they can do something because Adam programmed them well, but then adds that Adam is gone. "Meethexep" expresses shock and asks what they mean. "Mindset" inquires what "AdamMady" did to Adam. "AdamMady" replies that they disabled Adam's router and phone, implying they are responsible for his disappearance. It sounds like a crazy thing to do as it would be very scary for them and I personally would have called the authorities.</div>
