  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercup, because we're about to unleash a tsunami of insults on this dumpster fire of a flag!

First off, let's address the elephant in the room â€“ or, more accurately, the swastika on the flag. Seriously, what a monumentally unimaginative and poorly designed symbol for a movement supposedly about "superiority." It looks like a child tried to draw a windmill after one too many juice boxes. You know, if the point of this symbol was to cause suffering, they did a really bad job, I've seen better drawings in pre school. 

Now, the color scheme... Red, white, and black. Groundbreaking. It's like they raided a paint store that was having a clearance sale on the most basic, uninspired colors available. I bet Hitler just picked this shit at random. "Gotta be the cheapest stuff, folks, we have a war to pay for!"

And don't even get me started on the historical baggage this flag carries. It's basically a giant middle finger to anyone who values freedom, equality, or basic human decency. Every time I look at it, I can't help but think about the millions of lives destroyed, the countless acts of cruelty, and the sheer, unadulterated evil that this symbol represents. Is that suppose to be an achievement ?

In conclusion, this flag is a testament to bad design, even worse ideology, and a complete lack of taste. If this thing had a face, I'd punch it. Repeatedly.</div>
