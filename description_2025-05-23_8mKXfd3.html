  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these potential Balkan Cup groups with brutal honesty:

<strong>Group A:</strong>

•   <strong>Serbia:</strong> Likely favorites to top the group. They generally have a stronger squad depth and a history of dominating regional competitions.
•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> Always a tough opponent. Expect close, hard-fought matches, but Serbia might edge them out in overall quality.
•   <strong>Bosnia:</strong> Will struggle against Serbia and Croatia. They might be able to snatch a win against Slovenia, but overall, expect them to be fighting to avoid the bottom spot.
•   <strong>Slovenia:</strong> The weakest link in this group. They lack the star power of the other teams and will likely finish last.

<strong>Group B:</strong>

•   <strong>Montenegro:</strong> They have the potential to do well, but they're inconsistent. They'll need their key players to perform consistently.
•   <strong>North Macedonia:</strong> A decent team, but will struggle against Montenegro and Kosovo.
•   <strong>Kosovo:</strong> Dark horse of the group.
•   <strong>Albania:</strong> Solid, but not exceptional. They'll put up a fight, but may lack the firepower to consistently win against the other teams in this group.

<strong>Group C:</strong>

•   <strong>Romania:</strong> A team that often disappoints on the big stage. They'll need to overcome their mental fragility to succeed.
•   <strong>Bulgaria:</strong> Currently a mess. Don't expect them to advance.
•   <strong>Greece:</strong> With a bit of luck, they might surprise a few teams.
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> A powerhouse in Balkan football. They should dominate this group.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

•   Serbia and Turkey are the clear favorites to make it to the final stages.
•   Croatia, Montenegro, and Albania could be contenders if they're at their best, but they'll need a bit of luck and some strong performances from their key players.
•   The rest of the teams will likely be fighting for pride and trying to avoid embarrassing defeats.</div>
