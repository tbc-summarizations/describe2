  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this European Swiss system tournament's Round 1 with some harsh truths:

<strong>Top Tier (The Decent):</strong>

•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> 3-1 against Slovenia? Finally, some Swiss aggression! Though Slovenia must be truly awful to let that happen.

•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> Beating Greece 3-1? Decent show, but don't get cocky. It's Greece. Could be better.

•   <strong>Germany:</strong> 3-1 against Albania. Expected and boring. They should aim for more than just meeting expectations, but alas, the Germans are too efficient for innovation.

•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> 4-1 against North Macedonia. You call that impressive? It's North Macedonia! Show some real power, not just against a team that's happy to be there.

•   <strong>France:</strong> A clean 2-0 against Finland is just okay. Should have won the game with more goals. Step it up

<strong>Mid Tier (The Mediocre):</strong>

•   <strong>England:</strong> barely win against Georgia. Georgia isn't even top 30 in UEFA rankings, step it up England.

•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> 2-0 against Slovakia is decent, but not enough to impress. It's the BARE MINIMUM.

•   <strong>Bosnia:</strong> Beating Poland 2-1 is a bit of a shocker. Poland is not a great team but Bosnia isn't a great team either, but good show.

•   <strong>Czech Republic:</strong> Beating Italy 1-0 is not enough to celebrate for the Czech Republic. 1-0 isn't gonna cut it for a Euro Title.

•   <strong>Wales:</strong> 2-0 against Scotland? Embarrassing for Scotland. Wales, don't think you're hot stuff yet, it's still just Scotland.

•   <strong>Romania:</strong> Winning against Croatia 1-0 is not enough for either team to celebrate. Both these teams are terrible.

<strong>Bottom Tier (The Pathetic):</strong>

•   <strong>Spain:</strong> Needing penalties to beat Hungary at home. Absolutely PATHETIC. What a joke of a team.

•   <strong>Hungary:</strong> Losing to Spain on penalties? Should've won the game.

•   <strong>Iceland:</strong> 1-0 against Sweden doesn't change the fact you are irrelevant.

•   <strong>Serbia:</strong> Losing to Austria 1-0. Disgusting.

•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> Losing to Denmark 1-0. Sad.

•   <strong>Norway:</strong> Losing to Belgium is sad.

•   <strong>Slovakia:</strong> Losing to Portugal 2-0 isn't anything to be ashamed of, you are just bad.

•   <strong>Scotland:</strong> 2-0 loss to Wales? Should give up football now.

•   <strong>Italy:</strong> Losing to Czechia 1-0. You are also done for.

•   <strong>Finland:</strong> Losing to France 2-0 is nothing to be ashamed of, you are just bad.

•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> Losing to Romania? You are a terrible team.

•   <strong>Sweden:</strong> Losing to Iceland 1-0? Embarrassing.

•   <strong>Slovenia:</strong> Losing to Switzerland 3-1? You are just terrible.

In short, Round 1 was mostly unimpressive, with only a few teams showing any real promise. Many teams were pathetic and should get better or give up football all together. A lot of these teams do not have potential of winning the tournament and are just fillers.</div>
