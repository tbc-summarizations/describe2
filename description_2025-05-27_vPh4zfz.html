  <h1>Description for 22220.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to be blunt.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Josip Condric:</strong> He's a journeyman, plain and simple. Probably a 5/10, maybe scraping a 6 on a good day.
•   <strong>Mukhammedzhan Seisen &amp; Danila Karpikov:</strong> These are backups for a reason. Probably both a 4/10.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Aleksa Amanovic:</strong> Solid enough. Probably a 6.5/10.
•   <strong>Branimir Kalaica:</strong> Decent, but nothing special. A 6/10.
•   <strong>Kipras Kažukolovas:</strong> 5/10. Mediocre.
•   <strong>Aleksandr Marochkin:</strong> Consistent, reliable, a steady 6/10.
•   <strong>Sanzhar Anuarov:</strong> 4/10. Unremarkable.
•   <strong>Yan Vorogovskiy &amp; Dmitriy Shomko:</strong> Getting on a bit, aren't they? 5/10. Experience, but lacking pace.
•   <strong>Karlo Bartolec:</strong> 6/10. Does the job.
•   <strong>Marat Bystrov &amp; Abzal Beisebekov:</strong> Both maybe a 5/10 at best.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Max Ebong:</strong> Can add some quality. A 7/10.
•   <strong>Nazmi Gripshi:</strong> 5/10. Won't set the world on fire.
•   <strong>Arman Kenesov:</strong> 4/10.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ousmane Camara:</strong> Probably the best of the bunch. 7/10.
•   <strong>Elkhan Astanov:</strong> 5/10. Unlikely to be a game-changer.
•   <strong>Marin Tomasov:</strong> Past his prime, but still a 6.5/10.
•   <strong>Stanislav Basmanov &amp; Nurali Zhaksylyk:</strong> Both 4/10.
•   <strong>Geoffrey Chinedu &amp; Nnamdi Ahanonu:</strong> 5/10. Nothing to write home about.
•   <strong>Ramazan Karimov:</strong> 5/10.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

I'm going to be harsh, but fair. This squad is a solid 5.5/10. There are a few decent players, but there's a lot of mediocrity. It's a squad that looks like it's clinging to past glories. They're not terrible, but they're not exactly inspiring.</div>
