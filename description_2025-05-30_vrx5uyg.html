  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these Euro Quarter-Finals with no BS:

<strong>Germany vs. England: Germany 3 - 1 England</strong>

•   <strong>Germany:</strong> Ruthless efficiency is their game. They'll exploit England's defensive frailties, especially down the flanks. Their midfield, even if not at its peak, is tactically superior.
•   <strong>England:</strong> Overhyped. Their attack lacks the killer instinct against top-tier opponents. Their defense will crumble under sustained German pressure. Expect them to be a disappointment again.

<strong>Belgium vs. Portugal: Belgium 2 - 0 Portugal</strong>

•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> The Golden Generation, despite aging, still has bite. Their attack is too dynamic and versatile for Portugal's aging defense.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> Ronaldo's brilliance can only carry them so far. Their midfield is pedestrian, and their defense is prone to errors. A one-man team will fall short against a well-rounded Belgium.

<strong>Switzerland vs. Netherlands: Switzerland 1 - 2 Netherlands</strong>

•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> Determined and organized, but ultimately outclassed. They'll put up a fight, but lack the individual brilliance to match the Dutch.
•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> Finally playing with some swagger. Their attack is explosive, and their midfield is starting to gel. They'll overcome Swiss resilience with sheer firepower.

<strong>France vs. Spain: France 2 - 1 Spain</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> The team to beat. Mbappe, Griezmann, and Benzema – enough said. Their midfield controls games, and their defense is rock solid. They'll be too much for a rebuilding Spain.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> Promising, but still a work in progress. Their possession-based style will be stifled by France's physicality and tactical nous. They'll lack the cutting edge to break down the French defense.</div>
