  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text"><strong>Georgia vs. Luxembourg:</strong> Georgia has a slight advantage playing at home and with a more experienced squad. However, they often struggle to convert chances. Luxembourg, while generally weaker, has shown surprising resilience lately.

<strong>Prediction:</strong> A tight, cagey affair. <strong>Georgia will likely win 1-0 or 2-1</strong>. I think Georgia will have a slight advantage. I see Luxembourg putting up a fight.

<strong>Greece vs. Kazakhstan:</strong> Greece is a significantly stronger team. They have better players in every position and a more established footballing tradition. Kazakhstan has improved, but they lack the quality to compete with Greece at this level.

<strong>Prediction:</strong> A clear win for Greece. <strong>Greece will win 3-0 or 4-1</strong>. It's going to be a whitewash.</div>
