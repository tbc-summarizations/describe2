  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest prediction for that Euro 2024 qualifying group:

1.  <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> They should win the group without much trouble. They've got the talent and the resources. If they screw this up, it's a massive failure.

2.  <strong>Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> Even though they are the current euro champions, you cannot underestimate that they haven't had a good run recently and will struggle to beat Ukraine. It is most likely they will take second place as Ukraine are on the same level as them. 

3.  <strong>Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Solid team, lots of fight, but probably not enough to consistently challenge England or Italy. They will come close to Italy, if they get second place in the group.

4.  <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰:</strong> They will be near the bottom of the group and not take much of a threat.

5.  <strong>Malta 🇲🇹:</strong> Will be at the bottom with the least wins in the group.</div>
