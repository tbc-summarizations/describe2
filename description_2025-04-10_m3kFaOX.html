  <h1>Description for IMG_9982.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... a goddamn cryptid sighting plastered on a window? Looks like some kid's shitty art project gone horribly wrong. Like, did they just finish goonin' and decide to doodle this abomination? "Don't be a Morgan," it says. More like, "Don't be a retarded artist, respect the public!!" Jesus Christ, is that the best they could come up with? I bet the gruh who drew this thinks they're some kind of revolutionary, but they just look like a brain-dead baboon with a crayon.

And those teeth! OMAGUH! They look like they're trying to escape from that crooked mouth. Like, did this Morgan character get into a fight with a beaver and lose? Looks like they took a luht of inspiration on that. Fucking gap-toothed freak. And the eyes! They're staring into my soul, judging my entire existence. Like, "Pruh, what are you even doing with your life?" Bitch, I'm not the one with my face plastered on a public window looking like I just crawled out of a sewer.

Remember that time I saw that retard goonin that looked just like that? Yeah, that was some cuh shit.

And don't even get me started on the background. That's some zuh-tier urban hellscape right there. Gray buildings, barren trees, and a sky that looks like it's perpetually on the verge of raining. It's like they took all the joy out of life and shoved it into one depressing image.

This whole thing is a fucking dumpster fire. A cacophony of fail. Like, someone needs to take this shit down before it causes any more irreparable damage to society. Seriously, who approved this? Were they high? Fucking hell. Just burn it all. Burn it all to the ground and start over. And maybe, just maybe, we can salvage some semblance of sanity from this godforsaken mess. Now if you excuse me, I need to go bleach my eyes and scrub my brain clean of this unholy image. Fucking Morgan and their disrespect to the public!!</div>
