  <div class="discord-text">Okay, so you're feeling unprepared for exams, relatable! But let's turn that around. "No pen"? No problem! You've got your mind, your creativity, and probably a phone full of memes to help you brainstorm. "9 hours of gaming"? That's some serious dedication! Translate that focus into your studies - break it down into levels, strategize, and conquer. "Which exam?" You're not alone in feeling lost. Take a deep breath, figure out what you need to know, and take it one step at a time. "Bismillah" - Trust in yourself and the work you've put in. "Accepting fate"? Nah, you're not accepting anything! You're taking control, one study session at a time. "1.5 hours of sleep"? Okay, that's rough. But you're still standing! Power nap, chug some coffee, and tackle this thing. "100% Guessing"? Embrace the chaos! Sometimes, educated guesses are all you need. Just go in there and do your best. You got this, boys!</div>
