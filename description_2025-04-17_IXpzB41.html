  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up for a scathing review of Stop Breathin from this utterly baffling object show.

<strong>Stop Breathin: An Object Show Autopsy</strong>

<strong>General Information:</strong> Stop Breathin is a contestant in this obviously low-budget object show. What purpose it serves, other than to annoy the viewers, is unclear. Its existence is tied to a Tweet that includes the message "Stop breathin". It is a joke, making fun of the TikTok user Loganduran, who asks what song that is.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong> Visually, Stop Breathin is an eyesore. It's nothing more than a screenshot of a Tweet, crudely given legs and arms. The black scribbles meant to represent facial features are amateurish and disturbing. The lack of any coherent design screams laziness.

<strong>Personality:</strong> Stop Breathin's personality, much like its appearance, is completely irritating. It whines about losing. It's the kind of character that would throw a temper tantrum over a board game and then claim everyone else is cheating.

<strong>Abilities:</strong> In terms of abilities, Stop Breathin seems to be able to annoy people, which, admittedly, is a superpower in today's world. Beyond that, it offers nothing. No strategic thinking, no physical prowess, just constant complaining.

<strong>Final Rating:</strong> I give Stop Breathin a solid <strong>0/10</strong>. Its entire existence is a waste of time, resources, and brain cells. The object show would be better off without it.</div>
