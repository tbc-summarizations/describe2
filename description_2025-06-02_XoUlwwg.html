  <div class="discord-text">Alright, judging from these two pictures, here's what I think happened:

It looks like a catastrophic flood. The first image shows a developed area completely submerged, with cars, buildings, and infrastructure underwater. The second image, a wider view, reveals that a large area has been flooded. The terrain is inundated, and what were probably land features are now underwater. 

The possible causes could be a dam break, an extreme weather event (like a hurricane or massive rainfall), or even a tsunami if it's located near a coastline. Given the scope of the flooding, it must have been a sudden and incredibly powerful event.</div>
