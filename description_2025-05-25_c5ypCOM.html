  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a ranking of those strawberry images from best to worst, based purely on aesthetics and how appealing they are:

1.  <strong>Strawberry (The Mysterious Island)</strong>: Love the joyful expression. It's catchy.

2.  <strong>Strawberry (The Object Merry-Go-Round)</strong>: This one has charm. It looks well designed.

3.  <strong>Strawberry (Brawl For Paradise)</strong>: This one is also nicely designed and has a unique look.

4.  <strong>Strawberry (The Color Challenge!)</strong>: Not bad, quite unique.

5.  <strong>Strawberry (Shape Battle)</strong>: Fine, a solid strawberry, nothing special.

6.  <strong>Strawberry (Object Extraordinary)</strong>: This one looks a bit off, not very visually appealing.

7.  <strong>Strawberry (SLICE)</strong>: Its just a strawberry that looks like a slice

8.  <strong>Strawberry (Object Illusion)</strong>: Depressing and plain.

9.  <strong>Strawberry (Battle For Luxurious Hotel)</strong>: That face is just ugly.

10. <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin (Battle For Nitrous)</strong>: Just a weird image.

11. <strong>Strawberry Elephant (Battle For Nitrous)</strong>: An abomination. It looks awful

12. <strong>Strawberry Pigeon (Battle For Caspian Sea)</strong>: Its just weird and out of place

13. <strong>Strawberry Meeth (Battle For Nitrous)</strong>: Horrible and nonsensical. It looks like it was made with no artistic sense.

There you go. Hopefully, that's brutally honest enough for you.</div>
