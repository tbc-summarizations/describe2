  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text"><strong>Alright, buckle up buttercups, because I'm about to serve some piping hot takes on these supposed "Champions League" semi-finals:</strong>

<strong>Bayern vs. Feyenoord:</strong> Look at Bayern choking! Scoring 3 goals for nothing! That's the definition of embarrassing. And Feyenoord, congrats on winning a penalty shootout, so exciting. That is just pathetic and boring as hell.

<strong>Liverpool vs. Marseille:</strong> Let's talk about Liverpool, yeah? Getting absolutely humiliated in the second leg after thinking they had it in the bag? Classic overconfidence. And Marseille? Good for them for showing up in one leg, but let's see if they can actually play consistently. I doubt it. 

In the end, congrats to the winner but I don't like any of these team because of their weaknesses. But hopefully they don't disappoint me next time.</div>
