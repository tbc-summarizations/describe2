  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here is a fictional elimination order with 5 rejoins and 2 debuts, and my unfiltered opinions. I'll give you the brutal truth you asked for.

<strong>Elimination Order:</strong>

1.  <strong>YXuvg( U[iZ}v3.w !]$PTy OWS(&gt; L~^q8t:</strong> Let's be honest, no one even knows what this IS. Instant fodder.
2.  <strong>Garbage Human:</strong> Aptly named. We're not wasting time on this pathetic waste of space.
3.  <strong>Tiny Loser Chamber:</strong> The name says it all. Ineffectual and pointless.
4.  <strong>Red Coin:</strong> Useless. Just sits there and does nothing.
5.  <strong>Gray Block:</strong> As exciting as watching paint dry.
6.  <strong>San Marino:</strong> Does anyone even care about this place?
7.  <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed?:</strong> An interesting concept, but drags the show down.
8.  <strong>Toilet:</strong> Disgusting and unsanitary. Get it OUT.
9.  <strong>History of Benchodistan:</strong> Dull. No one wants a history lesson.
10. <strong>Plunger:</strong> Serves a purpose, but not on this show.
11. <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin:</strong> Immediately forgettable.
12. <strong>Dicey:</strong> Annoying and unreliable. Get the boot.
13. <strong>Cold Cow:</strong> Milquetoast. Lacks any real personality.

15. <strong>Water Cannon:</strong> Too basic to survive.
16. <strong>Face:</strong> Featureless and boring.
17. <strong>Announcer:</strong> We've heard it all before. Generic.
18. <strong>Coconut Elephant:</strong> A weird combo that doesn't work.

25. <strong>Lil B:</strong> Overhyped and overrated.
26. <strong>Evil Meethexep:</strong> Annoying and one-note.
27. <strong>Grandma:</strong> Too sweet and wholesome. Needs an edge.
28. <strong>Tierlisty:</strong> Pointless. Making tier lists is a waste of time.
29. <strong>Black Circle:</strong> Generic and lacks definition.
30. <strong>Black Hole:</strong> An overused trope. Needs to go.
