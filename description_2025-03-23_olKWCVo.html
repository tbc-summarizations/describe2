  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest take on those Euro 2024 qualifier play-off matches:

<strong>Israel vs. Iceland:</strong>

Israel has shown some moments of brilliance but they are very inconsistent and Iceland is a team known for upsets in big games, if Iceland play as they did in Euro 2016, Israel stand no chance, but realistically Iceland will win this game 2-1.

<strong>Bosnia vs. Ukraine:</strong>

Bosnia is a team of aging players who lack the pace and intensity to compete at the highest level and their defense is shaky. Ukraine, despite the ongoing turmoil, has a squad with young talent who are desperate to show the world what they are capable of. This game will be extremely tough for Bosnia. With the strength of Ukraine's midfield, Bosnia's defense will crumble. Ukraine will win 3-1.</div>
