  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Spanish squad with ruthless honesty. 

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (out of 10, at the time of the 2010 World Cup):</strong>

•   <strong>Coach Vicente del Bosque:</strong> 7. He managed egos well, but his tactics were often too cautious. He inherited a system, didn't create it.
•   <strong>Iker Casillas:</strong> 9.5. Peak Casillas. A true world-class goalkeeper and captain. Saved Spain on multiple occasions.
•   <strong>Víctor Valdés:</strong> 5. Good backup, but never truly challenged Casillas. A decent keeper, but prone to errors.
•   <strong>Pepe Reina:</strong> 4. A cheerleader more than a genuine goalkeeping option. Overrated personality.
•   <strong>Raúl Albiol:</strong> 4.5. Always looked clumsy and uncomfortable at this level. A squad player, nothing more.
•   <strong>Gerard Piqué:</strong> 8.5. A rock at the back, good on the ball. Still had some youthful mistakes in him but immense potential.
•   <strong>Carlos Marchena:</strong> 5. Reliable, but aging. A decent squad player for defensive cover.
•   <strong>Carles Puyol:</strong> 9. An absolute warrior. Heart, passion, and defensive brilliance. Past his prime, but still a beast.
•   <strong>Joan Capdevila:</strong> 7. A solid, dependable left-back. Never flashy, but rarely made mistakes.
•   <strong>Sergio Ramos:</strong> 8.5. An attacking threat and a fiery defender. Still prone to rash decisions, but immense talent.
•   <strong>Álvaro Arbeloa:</strong> 6. A functional, limited right-back. Did his job but offered little going forward.
•   <strong>Andrés Iniesta:</strong> 9.5. Pure magic. A game-changer, a genius on the ball. Scored the winning goal.
•   <strong>Xavi:</strong> 10. The conductor. Dictated the tempo, never gave the ball away. The heart of the team.
•   <strong>Cesc Fàbregas:</strong> 7. Talented, but struggled to break into the starting XI. Lacked the discipline of Xavi or Iniesta.
•   <strong>Juan Mata:</strong> 4. Looked completely out of his depth in that environment. Overrated and underperformed.
•   <strong>Xabi Alonso:</strong> 8. A great passer and defensive midfielder. Provided balance and composure.
•   <strong>Sergio Busquets:</strong> 8. A master of the dark arts. Understated, but crucial to the team's tactical setup.
•   <strong>Javi Martínez:</strong> 4. Never really got a chance. Looked raw and unready for this level.
•   <strong>David Silva:</strong> 7. A creative spark, but inconsistent. Sometimes drifted in and out of games.
•   <strong>Jesús Navas:</strong> 6. A one-trick pony. Pace and crossing ability, but little else.
•   <strong>David Villa:</strong> 9. A lethal finisher. Scored crucial goals throughout the tournament.
•   <strong>Fernando Torres:</strong> 4. A shadow of his former self. Clearly injured and lacking confidence. A major disappointment.
•   <strong>Pedro:</strong> 7. Energetic and direct. A valuable option off the bench.
•   <strong>Fernando Llorente:</strong> 5. A physical presence, but lacked the finesse to make a real impact.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong> 8.5

Here is why:

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Unbelievable midfield, solid defense, world-class goalkeeper, and a proven goalscorer in Villa.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Over-reliance on the midfield, lack of a true plan B, Torres's poor form. Del Bosque tactics were too safe.

This squad wasn't perfect, but their core was exceptional, and they knew how to win ugly.</div>
