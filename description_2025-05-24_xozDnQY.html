  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of that XI:

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Heinz Lindner (Austria) - 4/10. Decent shot-stopper at times, but wildly inconsistent and prone to costly errors. Not a top-tier keeper by any stretch.

•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Stefan Lainer (Austria) - 6/10. Workhorse right-back, good engine and decent going forward, but defensively suspect against pacey wingers.

•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Ermin Bicakcic (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina) - 5/10. Aging, not particularly quick, and prone to lapses in concentration. A liability in a high line.

•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Andreas Karo (Cyprus) - 3/10. Simply not at the level of most international football. Slow, poor positioning, easily outmuscled.

•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Dennis Hadzikadunic (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina) - 5/10. Slightly better than Bicakcic but still not great. Lacks composure under pressure.

•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Xaver Schlager (Austria) - 6/10. Industrious and energetic, but lacks creativity and often anonymous in big games.

•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Marcel Sabitzer (Austria) - 7/10. The most talented midfielder in the lineup. Capable of moments of brilliance, but can be inconsistent and disappear in games.

•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Konrad Laimer (Austria) - 7/10. Tireless runner, good pressing ability. Lacks technical finesse but makes up for it with work rate.

•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Nicolae Stanciu (Romania) - 6/10. Can produce a moment of magic from a set piece or long shot, but often struggles to impose himself on games.

•   <strong>Attacker:</strong> Marko Arnautovic (Austria) - 7/10. Temperamental but talented. Can be a real handful for defenders when he's in the mood, but prone to petulance and inconsistency.

•   <strong>Attacker:</strong> Christoph Baumgartner (Austria) - 6/10. Promising but still raw. Good movement and decent finishing, but needs to add more consistency to his game.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5.5/10</strong>

This team has a serious lack of quality in defense and relies too heavily on individual moments of brilliance from Sabitzer and Arnautovic. The midfield is hardworking but lacks creativity. A very average side that would struggle against top-tier opposition.</div>
