  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on Matchday 2 of the UEFA Champions League:

•   <strong>Ajax 🇳🇱 0-1 Real Madrid 🇪🇸:</strong> Ajax, you bottled it. One goal? Pathetic. Real Madrid, you're relying on past glory again. Zidane's legacy is being stained by mediocrity.
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain 🇫🇷 2-2 Red Bull Salzburg 🇦🇹:</strong> PSG, you're supposed to be world-beaters. A draw against Salzburg? Embarrassing. Spend more money, maybe it'll help you actually win something.
•   <strong>Olympiacos 🇬🇷 0-4 Manchester United 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> Olympiacos, just another Greek team destined for mediocrity. Manchester United, you're only good against teams that are practically non-existent. Don't get your hopes up.
•   <strong>Juventus 🇮🇹 1-1 Young Boys 🇨🇭:</strong> Juventus, you're so old you need walking sticks on the field. Young Boys, congrats on the draw, but you'll be back to losing soon.
•   <strong>Fenerbahce 🇹🇷 0-3 Barcelona 🇪🇸:</strong> Fenerbahce, stick to playing against teams in your own league. Barcelona, congrats on beating a team that's basically a retirement home.
•   <strong>AC Milan 🇮🇹 2-0 Legia Warsaw 🇵🇱:</strong> AC Milan, you're a shadow of your former self. Legia Warsaw, just another Polish team that no one cares about.
•   <strong>Anderlecht 🇧🇪 0-2 Bayern Munich 🇩🇪:</strong> Anderlecht, you're not even the best team in Belgium. Bayern Munich, you're only good because the Bundesliga is a farmer's league.
•   <strong>Liverpool 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 4-0 Sparta Prague 🇨🇿:</strong> Liverpool, good job beating a team from a country no one cares about. Sparta Prague, you're basically irrelevant.
•   <strong>Panathinaikos 🇬🇷 1-4 Borussia Dortmund 🇩🇪:</strong> Panathinaikos, another Greek team failing on the big stage. Borussia Dortmund, you're the eternal bridesmaids of European football.
•   <strong>Benfica 🇵🇹 2-0 Lech Poznan 🇵🇱:</strong> Benfica, at least you can beat a team that's actually terrible. Lech Poznan, you're just making up the numbers.
•   <strong>Rapid Wien 🇦🇹 0-1 Porto 🇵🇹:</strong> Rapid Wien, you're an embarrassment to Austrian football. Porto, you're just a feeder club for bigger teams.
•   <strong>Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 0-0 Slavia Prague 🇨🇿:</strong> Rangers, you're only good in Scotland because everyone else is even worse. Slavia Prague, another Czech team no one cares about.
•   <strong>Feyenoord 🇳🇱 1-0 Shakhtar Donetsk 🇺🇦:</strong> Feyenoord, you're only relevant because of your history. Shakhtar Donetsk, you're just a money-laundering scheme.
•   <strong>Club Brugge 🇧🇪 3-2 Basel 🇨🇭:</strong> Club Brugge, you're the best of a bad bunch in Belgium. Basel, you're Switzerland's only hope, and that's not saying much.
•   <strong>Marseille 🇫🇷 1-2 Dynamo Kyiv 🇺🇦:</strong> Marseille, you're a disgrace to French football. Dynamo Kyiv, you're only good because Ukrainian football is a joke.
•   <strong>Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 2-0 Galatasaray 🇹🇷:</strong> Celtic, you're only good in Scotland because everyone else is even worse. Galatasaray, you're just a washed-up team from a mediocre league.

There you go. No punches pulled, just pure, unadulterated honesty.</div>
