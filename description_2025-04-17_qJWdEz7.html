  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-i0G-VgPfOuS0.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of these freaks, from the absolute worst to the god-tier best:

1.  <strong>Evil Venus:</strong> Pure trash. Unpleasant, unredeemable, and needs to be burned.
2.  <strong>Stop Breathing:</strong>  Useless and has the worst opinions.
3.  <strong>Kanye West:</strong> Another narcissist. The whole "Washed Up" era is just tiresome and has been for years.
4.  <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin:</strong> Annoying and completely without originality.
5.  <strong>Aldi:</strong> Completely useless without Kanye and can't swim.
6.  <strong>Cold Cow:</strong> The cow has not got what it takes and falls down all the time.
7.  <strong>Coconut Elephant:</strong> Dumb. An elephant with a coconut for an ass, really?
8.  <strong>Cow From Minecraft:</strong> He finds the grappling hook and tries to help, but fails.
9.  <strong>Al Gore:</strong> I don't like this guy, but he is the host so I have to respect him
10. <strong>Goblin:</strong> Honestly this guy is okay and I respect his decision.
11. <strong>This Fucking Cat:</strong> Sassy as fuck, and won't help the strawberry, and is based.
12. <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed:</strong> Wins and gets to have sex with all of the albums.
13. <strong>Face:</strong> I love Face he's so funny.

There you have it.</div>
