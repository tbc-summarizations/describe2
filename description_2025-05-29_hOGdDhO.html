  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these Champions League semi-final first legs with the honesty they deserve.

<strong>Bayern Munich 0-3 Feyenoord:</strong> What in the world happened to Bayern? Getting absolutely dismantled at home? It's like they forgot they're supposed to be a European powerhouse and let a bunch of Dutchmen walk all over them. 0-3 is a disaster. They need a miracle in the second leg because right now, they look like a bunch of overpaid tourists on the pitch.

<strong>Prediction:</strong> Bayern will probably manage a win in the second leg but I doubt they'll have enough to overcome the 3 goals to move on as Feyenoord's defense is too good. So Feyenoord to the finals!

<strong>Liverpool 2-0 Marseille:</strong> Typical Liverpool. Efficient, clinical, and just generally unpleasant to play against. They did their job at home, no flashy nonsense, just a solid win. As for Marseille, they were lucky it wasn't more. They need a serious wake-up call if they want to stand a chance at home. 

<strong>Prediction:</strong> Marseille can dream all they want, but Liverpool is not going to just hand them a ticket to the final. Liverpool to win or draw, securing their spot!

So, we're looking at a potential final between two teams that actually showed up in the first leg: Liverpool and Feyenoord. Let's hope they bring the same energy to the second leg!</div>
