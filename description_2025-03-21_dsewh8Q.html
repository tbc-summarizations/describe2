  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those countries and their natural beauty, ranked out of 10:

•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 9/10. The rainforests are incredible, the beaches are stunning, and the biodiversity is off the charts. It's one of the most naturally beautiful countries in Southeast Asia.

•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 9/10. The Andes Mountains, the Amazon rainforest, and the coastline... Peru has some of the most diverse and impressive landscapes on the planet.

•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 8/10. Seriously underrated. The mountains are rugged, the rivers are crystal clear, and the forests are dense and unspoiled.

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 7/10. The coastlines and islands are beautiful, and the mountains are dramatic.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 6/10. Vast and diverse landscapes, from deserts to mountains to steppes. 

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 6/10. Has potential with its mountains and forests, but it needs more investment in preserving its natural beauty.

•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 5/10. Flat and forested, which isn't a bad thing, but it lacks the dramatic landscapes of some of the other countries on the list.

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 5/10. Similar to Estonia, it has some nice forests and lakes, but nothing that really stands out.

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 4/10. The countryside can be quaint, but it's mostly just rolling hills and farmland.

•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 3/10. The Nile is impressive, but the rest of the country is mostly desert. Not much natural beauty to speak of.</div>
