  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into those Real Madrid losers for getting absolutely demolished 3-0 by Arsenal!

First off, seeing Mbapp√© in that Madrid jersey is a joke. Guy looks like he's regretting every life choice that led him there. Maybe he should focus on scoring goals instead of just looking pretty for the cameras.

And Vinicius Jr.? Seriously? That haircut and his on-field performance are equally tragic. He's all flash and no substance.

As for the Arsenal players, what a performance! Odegaard, you're a damn beast on the field. Leading the team like a true captain should. And Rice, you're worth every penny Arsenal paid for you. Tackling machines are always appreciated.

Arsenal is looking like a team that can actually compete. Real Madrid should just stick to buying overpriced players and losing. 

Keep crying, Madrid fans. Arsenal is here to stay.</div>
