  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of that XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Jordan Pickford:</strong> 6/10. Prone to errors, but can pull off decent saves. Not a top-tier keeper.
•   <strong>Milos Veljkovic:</strong> 5/10. Lacks pace and can be exposed defensively. A weak link.
•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold:</strong> 7/10. Amazing going forward, poor defensively. A major liability in a back four.
•   <strong>Harry Maguire:</strong> 4/10. Slow, error-prone, and a constant source of panic.
•   <strong>Ardian Ismajli:</strong> 5/10. Solid but not particularly gifted. A Championship level player in the premier league.
•   <strong>Jude Bellingham:</strong> 9/10. World-class. High energy, goal scoring, all around talent.
•   <strong>Jordan Henderson:</strong> 6/10. Past his best, lacks creativity and bite.
•   <strong>Sergej Milinkovic-Savic:</strong> 7/10. Good physical presence and technique, but can be inconsistent.
•   <strong>Conor Gallagher:</strong> 6/10. High energy, but lacks the quality to consistently perform at the highest level.
•   <strong>Harry Kane:</strong> 9/10. Excellent goalscorer and playmaker. A true world-class striker.
•   <strong>Aleksandar Mitrovic:</strong> 7/10. A decent goalscorer.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5/10</strong>. The midfield is relatively poor and the defence is an absolute disaster that would cause them to be easily torn apart. Bellingham and Kane can't carry this team to glory. This team would be an easy win for most clubs.</div>
