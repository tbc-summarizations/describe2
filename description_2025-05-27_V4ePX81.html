  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of the 2014 Germany squad, player by player and then as a whole:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Joachim Löw:</strong> 7/10. Tactically flexible, but often stubborn. Benefited from a core of experienced players and a bit of luck.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Manuel Neuer:</strong> 10/10. Peak Neuer. A revolutionary goalkeeper who redefined the position. His sweeping and shot-stopping were unmatched.
•   <strong>Ron-Robert Zieler:</strong> 3/10. Decent backup, nothing special. Didn't exactly inspire confidence.
•   <strong>Roman Weidenfeller:</strong> 4/10. A solid veteran, but past his prime.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Kevin Großkreutz:</strong> 2/10. Overrated utility player. Pure passion, but limited skill.
•   <strong>Matthias Ginter:</strong> 4/10. Promising, but raw. Clearly not ready for a major tournament.
•   <strong>Benedikt Höwedes:</strong> 6/10. Reliable, but unspectacular. Filled in where needed.
•   <strong>Mats Hummels:</strong> 9/10. Elegant and intelligent defender. A rock at the back.
•   <strong>Erik Durm:</strong> 3/10. Another Dortmund player who was more hype than substance.
•   <strong>Philipp Lahm:</strong> 10/10. One of the greatest full-backs of all time. Impeccable technique, leadership, and tactical awareness.
•   <strong>Per Mertesacker:</strong> 6/10. Slow and cumbersome, but surprisingly effective. Experienced.
•   <strong>Jérôme Boateng:</strong> 8/10. Powerful and athletic. Could be prone to errors, but often dominant.
•   <strong>Shkodran Mustafi:</strong> 2/10. Showed he's not up for the task with a poor performance after coming in for Hummels.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Sami Khedira:</strong> 7/10. Solid and energetic. Good in the tackle, but sometimes lacks creativity.
•   <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger:</strong> 8/10. Warrior spirit. A midfield engine, though injuries had taken their toll.
•   <strong>Mesut Özil:</strong> 6/10. Inconsistent. Capable of brilliance, but often drifted through games. Not his best tournament.
•   <strong>Julian Draxler:</strong> 4/10. Talented, but immature. Needed more time to develop.
•   <strong>Toni Kroos:</strong> 9/10. Metronome. Dictated the tempo with his precise passing.
•   <strong>Mario Götze:</strong> 7/10. Scored the winning goal, but otherwise a frustrating player. Unfulfilled potential.
•   <strong>Christoph Kramer:</strong> 5/10. Average. An unexpected starter in the final, which showed a lack of better options.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>André Schürrle:</strong> 7/10. Impact substitute. Direct and dangerous.
•   <strong>Lukas Podolski:</strong> 4/10. Veteran presence, but largely ineffective.
•   <strong>Miroslav Klose:</strong> 7/10. Aging legend. Still had a knack for scoring important goals.
•   <strong>Thomas Müller:</strong> 9/10. Unusual, but effective. Scored goals and created chaos.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 8/10</strong>

This Germany squad was incredibly talented and well-balanced. They had a world-class goalkeeper, a strong defense, a dominant midfield, and enough firepower up front. However, they weren't unbeatable. They had moments of vulnerability and relied on individual brilliance at times. The coach got lucky but it was well-deserved after all his work.

Winning the World Cup doesn't automatically make them a perfect 10, but they were definitely one of the best teams of the tournament.</div>
