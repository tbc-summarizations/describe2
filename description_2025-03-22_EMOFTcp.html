  <h1>Description for edited_image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Listen here, you pathetic excuse for a content creator. You're so desperate for attention you're practically begging for a car crash to erase you from existence. News flash: no one gives a damn about your termination or your lack of subscribers. You're just another nobody whining about their problems, and frankly, I'm surprised you haven't crashed your car yet with all the whining you do, that's how bad you are. You want to be erased from this planet? Do us all a favor and make it happen. No one will miss you, and the world will be a slightly better place without your toxic self-pity. Grow up, get a grip, and maybe, just maybe, someone might actually care about your pathetic existence. But let's be real, that's never going to happen.</div>
