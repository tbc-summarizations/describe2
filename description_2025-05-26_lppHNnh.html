  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal, unfiltered summary of UCL Matchday 3:

•   <strong>Milan:</strong> Finally decided to show up and beat a team that's probably just happy to be there. Don't get too excited, Rossoneri, it's just Club Brugge.
•   <strong>Monaco:</strong> Scoring five against Red Star Belgrade is like dunking on a toddler. Impressive stats, zero actual challenge.
•   <strong>Arsenal:</strong> Squeezed out a 1-0 win against Shakhtar? Peak Arsenal. Barely scraping by against a team from a warzone - impressive.
•   <strong>Aston Villa:</strong> Beating Bologna? Wake me up when you beat someone relevant.
•   <strong>Girona:</strong> Slovan Bratislava... need I say more?
•   <strong>Juventus:</strong> Lost to VfB Stuttgart. The Old Lady is now an old hag. Embarrassing.
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> A 1-1 draw against PSV? More like Paris Saint-Germain-t enough. Choking against Dutch opposition as per usual.
•   <strong>Real Madrid:</strong> 5-2 against Dortmund. Showing everyone else how it's done.
•   <strong>Sturm Graz:</strong> 0-2 against Sporting CP. Not like anyone expected differently.
•   <strong>Atalanta:</strong> A goalless draw against Celtic. So boring I almost fell asleep writing this.
•   <strong>Brest:</strong> 1-1 against Bayer Leverkusen. Irrelevant to the rest of the tournament.
•   <strong>Atlético Madrid:</strong> Losing 1-3 to Lille? Cholo's tactics are officially outdated. Time for a retirement home, Diego.
•   <strong>Young Boys:</strong> Lost 0-1 to Inter Milan. Nobody cares about this one.
•   <strong>Barcelona:</strong> 4-1 against Bayern. You think Bayern would do better than that to be honest. 
•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg:</strong> 0-2 against Dinamo Zagreb. Who even watches these games?
•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> 5-0 against Sparta Prague. As expected
•   <strong>RB Leipzig:</strong> Lost 0-1 against Liverpool. Another loss to the reds.
•   <strong>Benfica:</strong> Lost 1-3 against Feyenoord. One of the worst clubs in Europe!</div>
