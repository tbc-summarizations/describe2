  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this team apart. Here's a brutal assessment:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Rui Patricio (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 5/10. Always been average, never great. Lucky to have made a career at top level.

â€¢   <strong>Dani Carvajal (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸):</strong> 6/10. Decent in his prime, but past it now and gets rinsed every game

â€¢   <strong>Lucas Digne (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 4/10. Always been a bang average player, only played for big teams so they had to fill quotas.

â€¢   <strong>Nacho (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸):</strong> 5/10. Utility player at best. Never truly stood out, just a filler.

â€¢   <strong>Joao Cancelo (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 7/10. Can contribute to the attack and can defend for his life and will put his body on the line. He is probably the only good one in this defence.

â€¢   <strong>Fabian Ruiz (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸):</strong> 5/10. Overhyped. Occasionally shows glimpses of talent, but lacks consistency.

â€¢   <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±):</strong> 6/10. Used to be great but went downhill after joining a terrible PSG team.

â€¢   <strong>Dani Olmo (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸):</strong> 6/10. He is a good player but not a game changer or world class.

â€¢   <strong>Bernardo Silva (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 7/10. A decent player but doesn't really stand out in any area. He is not a world class player and is overrated by many people.

â€¢   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 8/10. Still a goal threat, but his age and ego prevent the team from functioning properly. Only good thing he can offer is scoring at this age.

â€¢   <strong>Bruno Fernandes (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹):</strong> 7/10. Decent, but dives too much, always complains and has too many crazy shots that don't go in. He is not a team player at all.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5/10</strong>

This team is a mess. The defense is shambolic, the midfield lacks creativity, and the attack relies solely on individual brilliance. Too many average players, not enough world-class talent to make a difference. They'd get annihilated by any decent team.</div>
