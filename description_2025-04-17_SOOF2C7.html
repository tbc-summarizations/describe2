  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into a brutal and honest assessment of Penaldo from that object show. Hold onto your hats, because I'm not holding back.

<strong>General Information</strong>

Penaldo is a contestant in some kind of object-based competition. Honestly, not much is explicitly revealed about their origins or background, leaving their motivations a complete mystery. We only see them as a participant, a blank slate filled with the potential for greatness—or utter failure.

<strong>External Appearance</strong>

Penaldo’s appearance is an absolute joke! They have this comically large, toothy grin, wearing shades over their eyes, giving the impression that they are trying to act cool but end up being completely ridiculous. Their design doesn't evoke any sense of professionalism or competence.

<strong>Personality</strong>

The personality of Penaldo is insufferable. Based on the few snippets we get, their approach is childish and unfunny. The character comes across as obnoxious and self-satisfied, which is an absolute recipe for annoyance. Instead of winning hearts, Penaldo seems to be a magnet for irritation.

<strong>Abilities</strong>

It's hard to pinpoint Penaldo's specific abilities, but based on the footage they appear to be completely useless to their team. They don't display any discernible skills, leaving one to wonder how they even managed to make it this far in the competition. Penaldo brings nothing but empty air to the table, making one question their presence on the show at all.

<strong>Overall Rating</strong>

Penaldo is the worst contestant. Their personality is grating, their appearance is laughable for all the wrong reasons, and they seemingly contribute nothing. Penaldo deserves to be immediately eliminated, not just for being useless but for being a genuine irritant.

Let me know if you have more characters you want me to mercilessly judge!</div>
