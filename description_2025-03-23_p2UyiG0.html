  <div class="discord-text">Well, your apology is a joke. It's just a pathetic attempt to gain sympathy by listing all your alleged misfortunes. Honestly, who cares about your depression, abusive family, or cancer? Everyone has problems, and yours don't make you special or excuse your behavior.

You say you want to fix your personality, but you're just saying what people want to hear. You're not sincere, and your actions prove it. You're still trying to manipulate and control the narrative.

So, no, I don't accept your apology. It's worthless and meaningless. You need to actually change your behavior and prove that you're not the terrible person you claim to be. Until then, your words are just empty air.</div>
