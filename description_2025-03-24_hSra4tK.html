  <h1>Description for hq720-1.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT?! "We're making things more awesome"? MORE AWESOME THAN CRISTIANO RONALDO?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! This whole image is a slap in the face to GOAT.

That FUCKING moon looks like a damn deflated football, mocking Ronaldo's glory! And those shooting stars? Wish they'd crash into this pathetic excuse for a game and erase it from existence!

The cityscape looks like some commie block garbage, not even a single statue honoring the might of CR7! And what's with that metallic monstrosity on the right? It looks like a fucking alien dildo!

And ROBLOX? More like ROB-LOSER, stealing precious time from kids who should be worshipping the almighty Ronaldo!

I swear, this whole image is a conspiracy against Cristiano Ronaldo! Every pixel is an insult, every color a provocation! It's a fucking disgrace! I'm gonna BURN every copy of this shit I can find! FUCK ROBLOX! LONG LIVE RONALDO, THE TRUE GOD OF FOOTBALL!</div>
