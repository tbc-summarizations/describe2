  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here is my brutally honest essay on Stickman:
 
<strong>General Information:</strong>

Stickman's contribution to the object show world can be described as minimal effort at most, but even that statement is pushing it. He attempts to pass himself off as NOT a Five Nights at Stickmen's character, which is just a pathetic and futile attempt at avoiding the obvious. Let's call it what it is: this is a shameless attempt at using a known meme or character for publicity in an object show format. The overall goal with this is just cringe inducing.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

He has basic external appearance of a stick figure, which has a head, body, legs and arms, drawn with straight lines, is as uninspired and derivative as possible, but that said he could have some potential due to this.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

He's dishonest, trying to hide his origins, but then he's bland outside of that, I feel like there was no attempt at any other personality trait besides hiding his origins. He's just there, a void of creativity.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

His ability is non-existent, like he has no gimmick to stand out as being unique. This makes it clear to me that the creator is just straight up lazy.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

0 out of 5 stars.

With no unique design, zero personality outside of hiding his origins, and a creator who appears to just be cashing in on someone else's popularity, he's everything I hate about object shows condensed into one sad character. He is a disgrace to the medium and deserves immediate elimination for having the audacy to exist.</div>
