  <div class="discord-text">Here's an essay about the Cold Cow from the object show, based on the information provided:

<strong>Cold Cow: An Analysis of the Chill Bovine Contestant</strong>

Cold Cow is a contestant in the object show Battle for Nirrous. Little information is revealed about the character so far, except that it manages to win against Black Hole in the elimination phase.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Cold Cow's external appearance is strikingly simple: Cold Cow is a Minecraft mob brown cow, and is mostly made of brown.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

There's not much to say about Cold Cow, because it does not speak and we only see him in the elimination phase.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

As an object, Cold Cow has no unique abilities or demonstrated skills. Its victory in the elimination phase, however, proves that it has allies and can convince others to vote for his survival.

<strong>Overall Rating:</strong>

Cold Cow seems like a total idiot because it can't even speak or do anything. A 1/10.</div>
