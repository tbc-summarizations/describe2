  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest prediction for those UEFA Euro 2024 qualifier play-off matches:

<strong>Poland vs. Estonia:</strong> Poland should absolutely demolish Estonia. Let's be real, Estonia is a footballing minnow. If Poland doesn't win this by at least 3 goals, it's an embarrassment. Lewandowski, even if he's past his peak, is still miles ahead of anything Estonia can throw at them. Anything less than a comfortable win for Poland would be a massive upset.

<strong>Wales vs. Finland:</strong> This one's tougher, but I'm leaning towards Wales. They have home advantage and a more experienced squad. Finland can be dangerous, but their consistency is a major issue. I expect a tight, tense match, likely decided by a single goal. Wales' grit and determination should see them through, but it won't be pretty. If Bale were still playing, it would be a no brainer.</div>
