  <h1>Description for AQOzq1oXpHIzhPWgOPInAVwEgWOtAHfVdI7yetw5Ydpji-Nb8cLt3xaF4o35M-aMx1W3O6DP8O5IS7lkuODeAafq.mov</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Absolutely! Here’s what I think about this band of musical misfits:

Alright, it’s American Football, but I'm convinced half of them just rolled out of bed after a bad dream about the 1990s. Their "Perfect 10s"? More like "Perfect 1s" if we're judging by their choices.
 
•   First up, the guy with the questionable checkerboard hat. He picks k.d. lang? Great, another excuse for hipsters to feel superior. His voice is boring too so if he sings, he'll need autotune.
•   Then we have the hipster with the mustache that screams "I peaked in college." Arthur Russell? He says it sounds like someone made it for themselves with no one around. Sounds like a flop album to me.
•   Oh god, the guy in the camouflage hat. Claims to love Def Leppard. My ears are already bleeding at the thought. It sounds like someone just threw a bunch of instruments down the stairs and yelled into a microphone.
•   Lastly, we have the guy with the tattoo that probably says "No Regrets." Bob Dylan? Can't stand him. He sounds like a dying walrus gargling gravel.

They're more overrated than avocado toast at a vegan brunch.</div>
