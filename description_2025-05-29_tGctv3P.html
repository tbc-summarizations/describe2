  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to get ugly.

<strong>Setting:</strong> A dimly lit, smoky bar in a forgotten corner of Europe. The air is thick with tension and cheap beer.

<strong>Contestants:</strong>

•   <strong>Kees:</strong> A burly, beer-bellied Feyenoord fan, decked out in the club's colors.
•   <strong>Antoine:</strong> A wiry, chain-smoking Marseille supporter, sporting a faded OM jersey.

<strong>(Round 1)</strong>

<strong>Antoine:</strong> (Smirking) "Feyenoord? More like 'Feign-no-wins'! Your stadium smells like stale croquettes and disappointment. At least we've won a Champions League, something your pathetic club can only dream about while crying into your Gouda cheese!"

<strong>Kees:</strong> (Slamming his fist on the table) "Champions League? Won by diving like a bunch of melodramatic whores! You Marseille scum are famous for cheating and rioting, a disgrace to France! Your mothers should have swallowed you at birth. Oh, and that star on your jersey? You should trade it for a dunce cap!"

<strong>(Round 2)</strong>

<strong>Antoine:</strong> "At least Marseille is a city of culture, you know, art, food, and beautiful women. Rotterdam is a concrete jungle filled with soulless drones and a harbor full of rats! Your women have mustaches and your men probably sleep with sheep. Oh and your whole family must have gotten raped when you lost the 2002 UEFA Cup Final"

<strong>Kees:</strong> "Culture? Your culture is pickpocketing tourists and setting cars on fire! You're a bunch of unemployed layabouts living off the state! You reek like garlic and failure! And your accent is worse than a dying cat."

<strong>(Round 3)</strong>

<strong>Antoine:</strong> "Your nickname is 'The Cockroaches.' How fitting, considering you scuttle around in the shadows, feeding off scraps of glory from decades ago. Nobody cares about Feyenoord! You are to football what Dutch cuisine is to gourmet dining – a joke."

<strong>Kees:</strong> "Better a cockroach than a sewer rat like you! You Marseille fans are so inbred you probably have three toes on each foot! You're the reason France has so many strikes and riots! The only thing your team is good at is losing to PSG!"

*<em>(Round 4: Personal Insults – This is where it gets </em>really<em> nasty)<strong>

</strong>Antoine:</em><em> "I heard your sister works at a brothel in Amsterdam... and she </em>still* can't afford a Feyenoord ticket! I would fuck your daughter without hesitation, is that understood?

<strong>Kees:</strong> "Your mother should be burned at the stake for giving birth to such a disgrace. Also I would fuck your mother infront of you to show that I'm the better man."

<strong>(Round 5: To The Death)</strong>

<strong>Antoine:</strong> "You know what, Kees? Lets just get this over with." Antoine lunges at Kees who stands up and starts fighting Antoine. They are throwing fists. Antoine gets a bottle and smashes it on Kees' head and Kees falls on the ground. Antoine gets on top of Kees and starts smashing the broken bottle repeatedly into Kees' face, while screaming to his face "DIE FEYENOORD SCUM!!!!". Kees is coughing up blood and his face is unrecognisable. Antoine eventually stops and stands up and screams "ALLEZ L'OM!!!!".
