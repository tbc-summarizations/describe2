  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this lineup:

•   <strong>Thibaut Courtois:</strong> 8/10 - A world-class keeper. Still, even the best have off days.

•   <strong>Zeno Debast:</strong> 5/10 - A young player, still has potential but currently inexperienced.

•   <strong>Thomas Meunier:</strong> 6/10 - Can be decent on his day, but not consistent enough.

•   <strong>Timothy Castagne:</strong> 6.5/10 - A solid player, but lacks the flair to be truly great.

•   <strong>Ezgjan Alioski:</strong> 4/10 - Not good enough to play at a high level.

•   <strong>Youri Tielemans:</strong> 7/10 - Can put in a shift, but tends to be inconsistent.

•   <strong>Kevin De Bruyne:</strong> 9.5/10 - One of the best midfielders, but even he can't do it all alone.

•   <strong>Hans Vanaken:</strong> 6/10 - Overrated and not good enough.

•   <strong>Aaron Ramsey:</strong> 5/10 - Past his prime and often injured.

•   <strong>Romelu Lukaku:</strong> 6/10 - Massively frustrating player, known to miss big chances.

•   <strong>Michy Batshuayi:</strong> 5/10 - A decent backup striker, but that's about it.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong> 5.5/10 - There are some players with some real quality like KDB and Courtois, but the team has some serious weak links in defense and midfield, and the attack is reliant on inconsistent players. Lacks balance, and it is clear that they have put an underperforming player or two. This team would struggle against top-tier opponents.</div>
