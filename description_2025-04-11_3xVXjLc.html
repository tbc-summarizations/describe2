  <div class="discord-text">OH MY GOD, WHAT IS THIS ABOMINATION I'M SEEING ON THE SCREEN?! IS THAT A CHILD OR A GARDEN GNOME THAT ESCAPED FROM SOMEONE'S LAWN?! AND WHAT'S WITH THAT HAIR?! DID HE STICK HIS FINGER IN A SOCKET?! HE'S SITTING THERE LIKE A BLOB, TRYING TO OPEN A DRINK LIKE HE'S DECIPHERING THE DA VINCI CODE!

OH, AND LOOK AT THAT! HE'S TRYING TO BE ALL FANCY IN "FIRST CLASS" WITH THAT CHEAP COFFEE. NEWSFLASH, GENIUS, EVEN WITH THAT "FIRST CLASS" STICKER, YOU STILL LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD BE RIDING IN THE BAGGAGE CAR!

AND DID YOU SEE THAT?! HE THREW HIS TRASH EVERYWHERE LIKE A PIG IN A MUD PIT! NO MANNERS, NO CLASS, JUST A PURE DISPLAY OF DISGUSTING ENTITLEMENT! HE IS A PIG AND HAS MORE SENSE THAN HIM.

LOOK AT HIM, DRINKING ALL THAT FOOD AND TRASHING THE PLACE. SERIOUSLY, I BET HIS MOM HAS TO TIE HIS SHOES FOR HIM STILL.Â 

HE IS SO STUPID, HE NEEDS TO BE PUT DOWN LIKE THE ANIMAL HE IS.</div>
