  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here's how I see Round 2 playing out, no punches pulled:

<strong>1W 0L Bracket - The Winners Clash</strong>

•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 vs. Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> Germany's tactical flexibility will overwhelm a stubborn but limited Swiss side. The midfield battle will be key, and Germany's sheer quality will shine. <em>Prediction: Germany 3 - 1 Switzerland</em>

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 vs. Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> England's attacking prowess is too much for the Czechs to handle. England has much better defense and attacking than them. <em>Prediction: England 4 - 0 Czech Republic</em>

•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 vs. Iceland 🇮🇸:</strong> This will be a physical battle. Turkey's passion can only take them so far and Iceland has amazing mental strenght. <em>Prediction: Iceland 2 - 1 Turkey</em>

•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦 vs. Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> The Netherlands' superior squad and tactical discipline will be on full display. Bosnia has an atrocious defense that will be fully exposed by Netherlands. <em>Prediction: Netherlands 5 - 0 Bosnia</em>

•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴 vs. Austria 🇦🇹:</strong> A close affair between two sides with solid, if unspectacular, foundations. <em>Prediction: Romania 1 - 1 Austria</em>

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 vs. Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> France's individual brilliance trumps Spain's possession game. Spain lacks the killer instinct to punish France's defensive lapses. <em>Prediction: France 2 - 1 Spain</em>

•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 vs. Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> Belgium's age will show. Portugal has the fresher legs and more dynamism to exploit Belgium's slowing defense. <em>Prediction: Portugal 3 - 1 Belgium</em>

•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 vs. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Denmark's squad is simply on another level. Wales lacks the firepower to trouble a well-organized Danish defense. <em>Prediction: Denmark 3 - 0 Wales</em>

<strong>0W 1L Bracket - The Losers Fight for Survival</strong>

•   <strong>Sweden 🇸🇪 vs. Finland 🇫🇮:</strong> Sweden has the edge in quality. <em>Prediction: Sweden 2 - 0 Finland</em>

•   <strong>Slovakia 🇸🇰 vs. Albania 🇦🇱:</strong> Slovakia is not ready for what Albania has to offer. <em>Prediction: Albania 3 - 1 Slovakia</em>

•   <strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 vs. Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> Croatia's midfield experience will be too much for a gritty but ultimately limited Scotland. <em>Prediction: Croatia 2 - 0 Scotland</em>

•   <strong>Hungary 🇭🇺 vs. Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Ukraine's attacking talent will be the difference. <em>Prediction: Ukraine 3 - 1 Hungary</em>

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 vs. Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> Serbia's defense is vulnerable. Italy's creative attack will exploit that to the fullest. <em>Prediction: Italy 4 - 0 Serbia</em>

•   <strong>Norway 🇳🇴 vs. Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> Two defensive-minded sides, but Greece has a slightly sharper edge in attack. <em>Prediction: Greece 1 - 0 Norway</em>

•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰 vs. Slovenia 🇸🇮:</strong> Slovenia has more individual talent and a better tactical setup. <em>Prediction: Slovenia 2 - 0 North Macedonia</em>

•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪 vs. Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> Poland's experience and attacking options should see them through. <em>Prediction: Poland 2 - 1 Georgia</em>

These predictions are based on team quality, recent form, tactical matchups, and a healthy dose of my own brutally honest assessment. Deal with it.</div>
