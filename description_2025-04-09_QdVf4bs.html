  <h1>Description for image-9.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Absolutely not. Berishbaev clearly abused the !bigcode command, causing others to lose their 50 daily uses. There is no reason he should have access to it when he can't use it responsibly. His childish demands for "rights" and nonsensical "WOMEN'S RIGHTS!" outbursts further prove his immaturity and unsuitability for any privileges. He's a disruptive element, and restricting his access to the command is a perfectly justified action.</div>
