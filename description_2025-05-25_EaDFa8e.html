  <h1>Description for 1024px-Manchester_United_FC_crest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this squad apart piece by piece. I'll be as brutally honest as possible:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Ruben Amorim (🇵🇹):</strong> 7/10. He's got potential and has shown tactical nous at Sporting. Still unproven at the highest level, which is always a gamble. Needs to prove he can manage egos.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Tom Heaton (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 2/10. Backup at best. Offers very little in terms of playing out from the back.
•   <strong>Andre Onana (🇨🇲):</strong> 6/10. Prone to high profile errors. His distribution is good, but not good enough to cover up the errors.
•   <strong>Altay Bayindir (🇹🇷):</strong> 3/10. Just a placeholder. Probably not good enough to be a Premier League goalkeeper.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Jonny Evans (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 1/10. Club legend but is only there to retire comfortably.
•   <strong>Harry Maguire (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 4/10. Massively overpriced and mentally fragile. Ok if surrounded by world-class players, but a liability otherwise.
•   <strong>Victor Nilsson Lindelöf (🇸🇪):</strong> 4/10. Decent squad player. Not consistent enough to be a starter.
•   <strong>Luke Shaw (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Can be world-class when fit. Sadly, availability is always a question mark.
•   <strong>Matthijs de Ligt (🇳🇱):</strong> 8/10. A top-class centre-back. Commanding in the air and a good passer. One of the few bright spots in this defense.
•   <strong>Noussair Mazraoui (🇲🇦):</strong> 6/10. A solid fullback. Nothing particularly outstanding, but reliable.
•   <strong>Lisandro Martinez (🇦🇷):</strong> 8/10. Passionate, aggressive, and a good reader of the game. Adds a much-needed bite to the defense. His height could be a liability against taller opponents.
•   <strong>Leny Yoro (🇫🇷):</strong> 7/10. Young and promising. Has the potential to be world-class. A good investment for the future.
•   <strong>Tyler Fredricson (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 2/10. Doubt he's ready for the first team. Needs more development.
•   <strong>Ayden Heaven (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 2/10. Similar to Fredricson. Raw talent.
•   <strong>Harry Amass (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 2/10. Too early to judge.
•   <strong>Diogo Dalot (🇵🇹):</strong> 5/10. Inconsistent. Can be good going forward, but defensively suspect.
•   <strong>Patrick Dorgu (🇩🇰):</strong> 6/10. Decent left-back, needs more experience.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Casemiro (🇧🇷):</strong> 6/10. Past his prime but can still offer steel and experience. Slows down the play too much.
•   <strong>Manuel Ugarte (🇺🇾):</strong> 7/10. A tenacious defensive midfielder. Good at winning the ball back, but limited going forward.
•   <strong>Kobbie Mainoo (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 8/10. A breath of fresh air. Technically gifted, composed, and has a great engine.
•   <strong>Toby Collyer (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 3/10. Not ready for the step up.
•   <strong>Christian Eriksen (🇩🇰):</strong> 5/10. Too slow and inconsistent to be relied upon in the first team.
•   <strong>Bruno Fernandes (🇵🇹):</strong> 7/10. Capable of moments of brilliance. Tends to disappear in big games.
•   <strong>Mason Mount (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10. Injury-prone and not particularly outstanding in any area. Seems to lack confidence.
•   <strong>Alejandro Garnacho (🇦🇷):</strong> 7/10. Raw talent with pace and trickery. Needs to improve his decision-making and consistency.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Amad Diallo (🇨🇮):</strong> 4/10. A frustrating player. Shows glimpses of quality but lacks end product.
•   <strong>Joshua Zirkzee (🇳🇱):</strong> 7/10. Has potential but is unproven. 
•   <strong>Rasmus Højlund (🇩🇰):</strong> 6/10. Raw talent. Needs time to develop. Misses far too many chances.
•   <strong>Chido Obi-Martin (🇩🇰):</strong> 2/10. Too young to make a proper assessment.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 5/10</strong>

This squad has potential, but it's also riddled with flaws. There's a lack of leadership, quality, consistency, and mental strength in key areas. The defense is shaky, the midfield is a mix of talent and mediocrity, and the attack lacks a clinical finisher. Ruben Amorim has his work cut out for him.</div>
