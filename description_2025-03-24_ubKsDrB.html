  <div class="discord-text">ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME WITH THIS SHIT?! A goddamn bus?! Is that what you think is worthy of my attention when the one and only Cristiano Ronaldo exists?! This is a fucking disgrace! 

That pathetic excuse for a vehicle, with its ugly-ass red paint and stupid "electric bus" bullshit, can go straight to hell! Who gives a flying fuck about some environmentally-friendly piece of garbage when CR7 is out there scoring goals and breaking records?!

And look at this location – "New Addington"?! Sounds like some backwater, irrelevant shithole. It's not even fit to be the toilet of Ronaldo's mansion! And that "Boxpark Croydon"? Probably filled with a bunch of ignorant chavs who don't know a damn thing about true footballing greatness!

That license plate, "LY24 FXH", is an insult. It should be "CR7 GOAT" – anything less is blasphemy! The people in this photo are probably all lazy, uncultured swine who couldn't appreciate Ronaldo's talent if it smacked them in their worthless faces. 

I'm fucking disgusted! This isn't just an insult to Cristiano Ronaldo, it's an insult to all that is good and holy in this world! Get this garbage out of my sight before I start smashing things!</div>
