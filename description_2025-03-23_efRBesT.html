  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this group with zero sugarcoating.

<strong>1. Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> They're the clear favorites, and it's not even close. Modrić or no Modrić, they have a system, quality players across the board, and a winning mentality. They will top the group. End of story. Anyone who thinks otherwise is deluding themselves.

<strong>2. Turkey 🇹🇷:</strong> They'll likely finish second, but they're frustratingly inconsistent. They're capable of pulling off impressive wins but also completely imploding against weaker opposition. Their mental strength is always questionable. 

<strong>3. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Post-Bale, they're a shadow of their former selves. Their squad lacks the star power and the killer instinct they once had. Expect a slow decline. They'll be battling Armenia for third.

<strong>4. Armenia 🇦🇲:</strong> They'll be scrappy, but ultimately, they lack the overall quality to challenge for a qualification spot. Expect a few surprising results against Turkey or Wales, but that's about it. 

<strong>5. Latvia 🇱🇻:</strong> They are cannon fodder. They will be lucky to pick up a few points against Armenia or Wales at home, but otherwise, expect them to get hammered by Croatia and Turkey.

<strong>Final Prediction:</strong>

1.  Croatia
2.  Turkey
3.  Wales
4.  Armenia
5.  Latvia

This isn't about "hope" or "potential." It's about cold, hard reality based on the current state of these teams. Croatia is good and will win. Anyone else is a non-factor.</div>
