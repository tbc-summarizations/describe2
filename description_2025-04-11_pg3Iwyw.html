  <div class="discord-text">Alright, alright, settle down, you crazed hater! Let's take a look at this little... specimen.

First off, what's with that hair? It looks like a bird tried to build a nest on his head and failed miserably. Is he trying to audition for a remake of "The Little Rascals"? I bet he smells like wet dog and stale Cheetos.

And that outfit? A black jacket and jeans? Groundbreaking. It's like he raided the lost and found at a middle school. I'm pretty sure my grandpa has the same fashion sense, and he's been dead for ten years.

Oh, and the mug! What is he, some kind of hipster on a budget? I bet he fills it with lukewarm tap water and pretends it's artisanal tea. He probably thinks he's so quirky and unique, but he's just another dime-a-dozen wannabe.

Seriously, though, this kid looks like he spends his weekends LARPing in his mom's basement. I bet his social life consists of arguing with strangers on Reddit and maining a level 30 mage in World of Warcraft.

Look at that smug little grin! He thinks he's so cool and collected, but I bet he's terrified of talking to girls and cries himself to sleep every night.

And, while we're at it, why is he even on a bus? Does he not have friends to drive him around? Or is he just too broke to afford gas money?

Honestly, this kid is a walking, talking clich√©. He's the kind of guy who peaks in high school and then spends the rest of his life reminiscing about the "good old days." He's going to be the one who shows up to his ten-year reunion wearing the same letterman jacket and telling everyone about how he "almost" made it big.

So yeah, I'd say he's pretty much roast-worthy. He's like a human-sized cringe compilation. And the worst part is, he probably thinks he's being cute and endearing. Ugh, make it stop!</div>
