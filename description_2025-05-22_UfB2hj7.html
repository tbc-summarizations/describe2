  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest rating of that starting XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Goalkeeper: Rui PatrÃ­cio (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 5/10. He's past his prime and relies on experience rather than athleticism these days. Can be a liability against top opposition.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: RÃºben Dias (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 8/10. One of the best centre-backs in the world, but heavily reliant on a solid defensive partner to cover his occasional lapses.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: NÃ©lson Semedo (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 4/10. Always inconsistent. Prone to defensive errors and doesn't offer enough going forward.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: JoÃ£o Cancelo (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 7/10. Excellent going forward and can create chances, but defensively suspect. Better as a wing-back in a system that provides cover.

â€¢   <strong>Defender: Milan Å kriniar (Slovakia) ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°:</strong> 6/10. Used to be a world-class defender, but injury issues have definitely taken a toll. Far too reliant on his partners doing well.

â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: JoÃ£o Palhinha (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 7/10. A solid defensive midfielder, great at breaking up play and shielding the back four. Lacks creativity and passing range.

â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Bernardo Silva (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 8/10. Highly talented and versatile, but can drift in and out of games. Needs to be more consistent to be considered world-class.

â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Danilo Pereira (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 5/10. A limited player who offers little more than physical presence. Slow on the ball and prone to clumsy fouls.

â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: TomÃ¡Å¡ Suslov (Slovakia) ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°:</strong> 4/10. A weak link in this team. Lacks the quality to compete at this level.

â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Bruno Fernandes (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 6/10. Exceptionally inconsistent. Too reliant on penalties, and is selfish and too eager to take long shots from outside the box

â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹:</strong> 5/10. A shadow of his former self. Still scores goals, but slows down the attack and offers little else.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 5/10</strong>

This team has some individual quality, but it is poorly balanced. The defense is shaky, the midfield lacks creativity, and the attack is overly reliant on aging players. Without a tactical overhaul and some better player selections, this team won't achieve anything significant.</div>
