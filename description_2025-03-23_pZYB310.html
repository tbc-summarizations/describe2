  <h1>Description for MapChart_Map_1.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this map of European national pride, shall we?

First off, anyone who "deeply admires" Germany and Finland has a questionable taste in governments. One is a bureaucratic behemoth strangling its citizens with red tape, and the other one seems to be in a perpetual state of trying to figure out what it is.

Then you have the folks who are just "meh" about their government but like the country. That's just sad. It sounds like a toxic relationship. "Yeah, the government is awful, but I stay for the scenery."

And the person who made this map must be from Russia or China with a deep inferiority complex, or is just really disconnected from reality.

This whole map screams of someone who's desperately trying to convince themselves they're happy with their country choices while simultaneously complaining about everything wrong with them. Get a grip, and maybe a passport.</div>
