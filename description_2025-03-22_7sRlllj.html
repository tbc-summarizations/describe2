  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this roasting session underway. Buckle up, buttercups, because I'm not pulling any punches.

•   <strong>Run-DMC:</strong> So iconic, but also so...stuck in the '80s. Did they ever evolve or just keep wearing Adidas tracksuits until the end of time?

•   <strong>The Beatles:</strong> Overrated mop-tops. Their music is fine, but their screaming fans were the original Karens, demanding attention for mediocrity.

•   <strong>Eminem:</strong> The angry white rapper everyone used to be afraid of. Now he's just the dad yelling at clouds, wondering why mumble rap is more popular.

•   <strong>Drake:</strong> He's like the emotional support animal of pop rap. So sensitive and whiny. Someone get this man a therapist, not a microphone.

•   <strong>Bjork:</strong> The ultimate art school drop-out. Her music sounds like a computer glitching out while having an existential crisis.

•   <strong>Slayer:</strong> The metal band for people who peaked in high school. They're still playing the same riffs, and their fans are still moshing in the Walmart parking lot.

•   <strong>Cyndi Lauper:</strong> "Girls Just Want to Have Fun"? More like "Girls Just Want Attention." Her voice is annoying, and her fashion choices are a crime against humanity.

•   <strong>Talking Heads:</strong> David Byrne's awkward dancing is the only thing anyone remembers about them. Their music is just elevator music for hipsters.

•   <strong>Lil Wayne:</strong> The guy who made auto-tune cool, but also ruined it for everyone else. His lyrics are nonsense, and his voice sounds like a frog gargling motor oil.

•   <strong>Kraftwerk:</strong> These guys were obsessed with robots, and their music sounds like it. Cold, sterile, and about as exciting as a tax audit.

•   <strong>The Beach Boys:</strong> Wholesome surf rock that masks some serious daddy issues. Their harmonies are creepy, and their lyrics are about as deep as a kiddie pool.

•   <strong>Jay-Z:</strong> He's rich, we get it. His music is just an advertisement for his own success. Someone needs to remind him that money can't buy taste.

•   <strong>Nirvana:</strong> Kurt Cobain was the poster child for teenage angst. Their music is great if you like whining and wearing flannel, but come on, grow up.

•   <strong>Elvis Costello:</strong> The angry nerd who somehow became a rock star. His glasses are bigger than his talent, and his voice is grating.

•   <strong>Queen:</strong> Freddie Mercury was a legend, but the rest of the band was just...there. Their music is pompous and overblown, like a bad opera.

•   <strong>Kanye West:</strong> The ultimate narcissist. His music is a mixed bag, but his ego is consistently awful. Someone needs to tell him he's not a genius, just a loudmouth.

•   <strong>Metallica:</strong> These guys used to be metal gods, now they're just aging rockers milking their old hits. Their haircuts are embarrassing, and their music is boring.

•   <strong>The Velvet Underground:</strong> Lou Reed was a miserable poet, and their music is just a soundtrack for urban decay. Depressing and overrated.

•   <strong>Bob Dylan:</strong> The mumbling prophet of rock. No one understands what he's saying, but everyone pretends to. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard.

•   <strong>The Rolling Stones:</strong> Aging rockers who refuse to retire. Their music is okay, but their faces look like they've been gargling gravel for 50 years.

•   <strong>Public Enemy:</strong> They yelled about the man for decades. Meanwhile, they became the man. Hypocrites!

•   <strong>Radiohead:</strong> Existential dread set to music. Play it at your next pity party.

•   <strong>Miles Davis:</strong> Cool jazz for people who want to seem sophisticated but don't actually like jazz.

•   <strong>Sex Pistols:</strong> Punk rock for people who can't play instruments. Anger without a cause, or talent.

•   <strong>The Who:</strong> Destroying hotel rooms doesn't make you rock stars. It makes you childish vandals.

•   <strong>The Doors:</strong> Jim Morrison thought he was a poet. Everyone else just saw a drunk rambling.

•   <strong>Pink Floyd:</strong> Prog rock for people who think they're deep. Their music is just a snoozefest.

•   <strong>Led Zeppelin:</strong> Stolen blues riffs and screaming vocals. Originality? Never heard of it.

•   <strong>Leonard Cohen:</strong> The poet laureate of gloom. If you're not already depressed, his music will get you there.

•   <strong>Stevie Wonder:</strong> Blind, but still managed to write cheesy love songs. A miracle, I guess.

•   <strong>Marvin Gaye:</strong> Sang about soul but was a mess in real life. Don't meet your heroes.

•   <strong>The Clash:</strong> Punk with a message, but mostly just shouting. A for effort, D for execution.

•   <strong>Black Sabbath:</strong> Doom and gloom for the perpetually bored. Maybe try a hobby.

•   <strong>Ramones:</strong> Three chords and a sneer. Punk rock in its purest, dumbest form.

•   <strong>AC/DC:</strong> Same three chords since 1973. But what did people expect from australians?

•   <strong>Dr Dre:</strong> Making money and owning hip hop since the 80s, but the problem is that his discography is not that crazy

•   <strong>NWA:</strong> Hip Hop group talking about drugs, violence, and the police while living lives of luxury, being hypocritical.

There you go! Let me know if you need more.</div>
