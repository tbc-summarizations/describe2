  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Nottingham Forest squad and their chances:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Coach: Nuno Espirito Santo:</strong> 6/10 - A manager who has peaked long ago, his initial impact can be decent, but his tactical rigidity often gets exposed. His inability to adapt and rely on individual brilliance is a massive concern. He is just a fraud merchant and has no business managing a premier league team.

•   <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>
•   Wayne Hennessey: 3/10 - Way past his prime, prone to errors, and doesn't command his area effectively.
•   Matz Sels: 5/10 - A journeyman goalkeeper, somewhat average in all areas. Not a game-changer.
•   Carlos Miguel: N/A - Unknown quantity; potential unknown, but unlikely to be a significant upgrade.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>
•   Ola Aina: 4/10 - A very average defender who can defend well but lacks any attacking prowess.
•   Willy Boly: 5/10 - Aging, injury-prone, and slow. His experience is limited by his physical decline.
•   Nikola Milenkovic: 6/10 - A solid defender, but lack of pace and agility limits his effectiveness in a high line.
•   Morato: 6/10 - Decent potential, but unproven in the Premier League and prone to inconsistency.
•   Zach Abbott: N/A - Young and inexperienced. Unlikely to make a significant impact.
•   Murillo: 7/10 - Strong, athletic, and good on the ball. One of the better players in the squad, but still raw.
•   Alex Moreno: 6/10 - Solid full-back, dependable, but lacking genuine star quality.
•   Harry Toffolo: 5/10 - Workmanlike, but limited technically and defensively vulnerable.
•   Neco Williams: 5/10 - Energetic, but often lacks composure and tactical awareness.
•   Eric de Silva Moreira: N/A - Another youth player; too early to assess properly.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   Ryan Yates: 4/10 - A Championship-level player at best. Lacks the technical ability and vision for the Premier League.
•   Ibrahim Sangare: 5/10 - Physically strong, but often clumsy in possession and tactically undisciplined.
•   Nicolas Dominguez: 6/10 - A hardworking midfielder with decent passing range. Decent but unspectacular.
•   Elliot Anderson: 6/10 - Promising youngster with good technique and vision. Needs more game time to develop.
•   Danilo: 6/10 - Energetic and box-to-box, but inconsistent in his decision-making and defensive positioning.
•   Morgan Gibbs-White: 7/10 - The creative spark of the team. However, he can be inconsistent and needs to add more goals to his game.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>
•   Anthony Elanga: 6/10 - Fast and direct, but lacks end product and often makes poor decisions in the final third.
•   Jota Silva: 5/10 - Decent technique, but lacks the physicality and pace to be a consistent threat.
•   Callum Hudson-Odoi: 5/10 - Flashes of brilliance but prone to injuries and lacks consistency. A massive underachiever.
•   Ramon Sosa: N/A - Unproven. A gamble signing that is unlikely to turn up.
•   Joel Ndala: N/A - Very young and unlikely to feature prominently.
•   Chris Wood: 4/10 - A target man who is only good at finishing. His overall play is limited and his goals have dried up.
•   Taiwo Awoniyi: 7/10 - Strong, good finisher, and capable of holding the ball up well. Prone to injuries, so is only rated high here.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong> 4.5/10

This is a squad lacking in quality and balance. There are very few players that a top-half Premier League side would want and the team is far too reliant on moments of individual brilliance.

•   <strong>Defense:</strong> It is simply not good enough. Too many aging or limited players that are not suitable for the premier league.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> Lacks creativity and steel. Too many workmanlike players that lack quality on the ball.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> Too reliant on Awoniyi and Gibbs-White. Lack of genuine quality and depth.
•   <strong>Coaching:</strong> Espirito Santo is not the man to get the best out of this squad. His tactical limitations and tendency to set up negatively will stifle the team's potential.

Nottingham Forest is destined for relegation with this squad. They need a massive clear-out and rebuild to have any hope of competing in the Premier League.</div>
