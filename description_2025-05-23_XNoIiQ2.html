  <div class="discord-text">The image shows a one-star Google Play Store review from "A Google user" on August 6, 2019. The reviewer is complaining about excessive ads in the game, stating that an ad appears every time they make a mistake. They express extreme frustration, claiming to have broken their phone due to the game and vowing never to play the developer's games again. They also brag about spending $1000 on a new phone. The review has been found helpful by 130 people. The review is poorly written, demonstrating a clear lack of intelligence and self-control on the part of the reviewer.</div>
