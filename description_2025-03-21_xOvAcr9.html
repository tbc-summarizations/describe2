  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of the handsomeness and strength of men from those countries, on a scale of 1 to 10:

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 7/10. They have that Mediterranean charm and some ruggedness, but sometimes lack overall strength.
•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 5/10. Can be handsome, but often not particularly strong. Tend to be a bit soft around the edges.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 4/10. Many are just plain pasty and weak. A few exceptions, but overall unimpressive.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 8/10. Strong, resilient, and often possess striking looks. They've been through tough times and it shows in their character.
•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 3/10. Generally smaller in stature and not known for their physical strength. Facial features are average.
•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 4/10. Often on the shorter side, and not known for strength. Handsome in a few cases, but overall quite average.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 7/10. Solid, good-looking, and strong. A decent combination of looks and physical presence.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 6/10. Possess some interesting features due to their Central Asian heritage. Strength varies, but can be impressive.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 5/10. Tend to be somewhat bland in appearance, and not particularly strong. On the weaker side of European men.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 9/10. Strong, handsome, and have a certain intensity about them. They have a fierce spirit.

There you go – brutally honest. Take it or leave it.</div>
