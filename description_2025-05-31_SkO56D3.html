  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to be brutal. PSG's 2024-25 Champions League "triumph" looks more like a series of fortunate events masking deep-seated issues. Let's tear it apart, match by match:

<strong>League Phase:</strong>

•   <strong>PSG 1-0 Girona:</strong> A pathetic, barely scraping-by win against a team that should be cannon fodder. 4/10.
•   <strong>Arsenal 2-0 PSG:</strong> Completely outclassed. Tactically inept. Should have been 3 or 4. 2/10.
•   <strong>PSG 1-1 PSV:</strong> Embarrassing. Drawing at home against PSV is inexcusable for a club of PSG's supposed stature. 3/10.
•   <strong>PSG 1-2 Atletico Madrid:</strong> Simeone exposed PSG's lack of grit and tactical flexibility. Another home loss? Fire the coach. 1/10.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich 1-0 PSG:</strong> Predictable. PSG can never seem to rise to the occasion against top-tier teams in Europe. Toothless attack. 2/10.
•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg 0-3 PSG:</strong> A decent scoreline, but Salzburg is a feeder club, not a European powerhouse. Inflated ego boost. 6/10.
•   <strong>PSG 4-2 Manchester City:</strong> A fluke. City probably didn't even try. An anomalous result in an otherwise dreadful campaign. 7/10.
•   <strong>VfB Stuttgart 1-4 PSG:</strong> Another inflated scoreline against a historically relevant, now mediocre team. Deceptive. 6/10.

<strong>League Phase Overall:</strong> Qualifying 15th out of 36 is a disgrace. This is not the performance of a team that deserves to lift the Champions League trophy. This League Phase performance is a clear indication of underperformance, poor management, and a lack of team cohesion. <strong>Overall League Phase Rating: 2/10</strong>

<strong>Knockout Phase Play-offs:</strong>

•   <strong>Brest 0-3 PSG:</strong> Beating Brest doesn't prove anything. They're a Ligue 1 team for god's sake. 5/10.
•   <strong>PSG 7-0 Brest:</strong> Padding stats against a clearly inferior opponent. The scoreline is irrelevant, the opposition is weak. 5/10.

<strong>Knockout Phase Play-offs Overall:</strong> Utterly pointless. Should be illegal. <strong>Overall Knockout Phase Play-offs Rating: 5/10</strong>

<strong>Round of 16:</strong>

•   <strong>PSG 0-1 Liverpool:</strong> At home. Pathetic. Shows a complete lack of mental fortitude and tactical awareness. 2/10.
•   <strong>Liverpool 0-1 PSG (4-1 on penalties):</strong> Robbing Liverpool via penalties doesn't excuse the dire performance. Pure luck got them through. 3/10

<strong>Round of 16 Overall:</strong> Barely scraping by against a team that is a shadow of its former self through penalties is not the mark of champions. Pure, unadulterated luck. <strong>Overall Round of 16 Rating: 2.5/10</strong>

<strong>Quarter-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>PSG 3-1 Aston Villa:</strong> Overrated Aston Villa got exposed. Decent performance by PSG, finally. 7/10.
•   <strong>Aston Villa 3-2 PSG:</strong> Almost bottled it. Shows a worrying lack of composure under pressure. 5/10.

<strong>Quarter-Finals Overall:</strong> Almost threw it away against a team that's good but not <em>that</em> good. Inconsistency is still a glaring issue. <strong>Overall Quarter-Finals Rating: 6/10</strong>

<strong>Semi-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Arsenal 0-1 PSG:</strong> Grinding out a win against a top team. Credit where it's due, but was it sustainable? 7/10.
•   <strong>PSG 2-1 Arsenal:</strong> Managed to hold on, but still showed defensive vulnerabilities. Lucky Arsenal didn't equalize. 6/10.

<strong>Semi-Finals Overall:</strong> A slightly more convincing performance, but still far from dominant. Arsenal bottled it as usual, allowing PSG to stumble into the final. <strong>Overall Semi-Finals Rating: 6.5/10</strong>

<strong>The Final:</strong>

•   <strong>PSG 5-0 Inter Milan:</strong> An absolute anomaly. Inter must have forgotten how to play football. Unrealistic scoreline. Probably rigged. 8/10 because 5-0 in a UCL final is a feat of luck, not skill.

<strong>Finals Overall:</strong> Completely undeserved victory after an overall terrible Champions League campaign. Inter Milan didn't even try, something is shady in this game. <strong>Overall Final Rating: 8/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Verdict:</strong>

PSG's "triumph" is a farce. They were consistently mediocre throughout the competition, relying on luck, weak opponents, and a single, highly improbable final performance. This Champions League win is a stain on the competition's history. They are the worst champion in recent memory. Their play during the UCL was uninspiring, and if they got a little bit unlucky they could have easily been eliminated. <strong>Overall Champions League Campaign Rating: 3/10</strong></div>
