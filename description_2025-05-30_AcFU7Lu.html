  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my unfiltered take on these Round 3 matches:

<strong>2W 0L</strong>

•   <strong>Turkey vs. Switzerland:</strong> Turkey, you absolute bottlers! You couldn't even manage a draw against the Swiss? Get better.
•   <strong>Denmark vs. Netherlands:</strong> Denmark gave it a good try. Netherlands has a lot of talent so they're good.
•   <strong>Belgium vs. Austria:</strong> I never liked Austria in the first place. Five goals is a big enough result to show how bad they are as a squad.
•   <strong>France vs. England:</strong> France doesn't deserve to have even 1 goal, it's just a terrible country to begin with. England proved why they're a powerhouse in the sport.

<strong>1W 1L</strong>

•   <strong>Germany vs. Romania:</strong> Germany drawing against Romania? Penalties? Pathetic from the Germans. Romania is doing so good
•   <strong>Bosnia vs. Wales:</strong> Bosnia is the worst. Wales looks like a good team this tournament.
•   <strong>Albania vs. Italy:</strong> Albania's getting steamrolled?
•   <strong>Greece vs. Spain:</strong> Greece should never be allowed into any football tournament, but Spain are good.
•   <strong>Hungary vs. Czechia:</strong> Hungary got something here. Czechia can get relegated immediately.
•   <strong>Iceland vs. Sweden:</strong> Sweden being destroyed by Iceland? Are you joking? Get good.
•   <strong>Croatia vs. Georgia:</strong> Decent game from the Croatians. Georgia should never be allowed into any football tournament.
•   <strong>Portugal vs. Slovenia:</strong> Another win for Ronaldo.

<strong>0W 2L</strong>

•   <strong>Ukraine vs. Scotland:</strong> Ukraine keeps losing, is so good to see. Scotland is just better.
•   <strong>Slovakia vs. Norway:</strong> Slovakia, go back to being part of Czechia. That's a good result by Norway.
•   <strong>Poland vs. Finland:</strong> Poland is just garbage and Lewandowski should retire from the national team. Finland, are you kidding me? How can a country even produce a professional team?
•   <strong>North Macedonia vs. Serbia:</strong> North Macedonia winning against Serbia? Good for them, Serbian are overrated.</div>
