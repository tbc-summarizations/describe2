  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those Nations League results:

•   <strong>Croatia 2-0 France:</strong> France is utterly pathetic. They're playing like they don't even want to be on the pitch. Croatia isn't amazing, but they actually look like they're trying.

•   <strong>Denmark 1-0 Portugal:</strong> Portugal is overrated. Denmark is a tough team, and they showed it. Ronaldo's getting old; time to face facts.

•   <strong>Italy 1-2 Germany:</strong> Italy can't rely on history forever. Germany's back, and Italy is falling behind. Time for a serious rebuild.

•   <strong>Netherlands 2-2 Spain:</strong> A boring draw. Both teams are coasting. Needs more intensity.

•   <strong>Turkey 3-1 Hungary:</strong> Turkey's always been inconsistent, but this is a solid win. Hungary needs to step up.

•   <strong>Austria 1-1 Serbia:</strong> A snoozefest. Who cares?

•   <strong>Greece 0-1 Scotland:</strong> Scotland grinds out the win. Typical.

•   <strong>Ukraine 3-1 Belgium:</strong> This is surprising, in a bad way for Belgium. Ukraine showed incredible determination given their current situation.

•   <strong>Armenia 0-3 Georgia:</strong> Georgia dominates. Armenia is useless.

•   <strong>Bulgaria 1-2 Ireland:</strong> Ireland takes a crucial away win. Bulgaria is a mess.

•   <strong>Kosovo 2-1 Iceland:</strong> Kosovo is showing some promise. Iceland is past their prime.

•   <strong>Slovakia 0-0 Slovenia:</strong> Another pointless draw. I'm already forgetting about this one.</div>
