  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you want a harsh ranking? Here we go:

1.  <strong>Tennis Ball Bird:</strong> Completely forgettable. Zero personality. Just a bird that looks like a tennis ball and what's the point of its existence. 
2.  <strong>Face:</strong> Generic, lifeless, and adds nothing to the show. It is simply a basic drawing.
3.  <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin:</strong> A strawberry with a cat face. Why? There's nothing going on with it. Not interesting, not funny, just a wasted slot. 
4.  <strong>Cow From Minecraft:</strong> A low-resolution Minecraft cow. It's not like a distinctive design or a hilarious concept, just something that fills the void of other stuff. I think people are running out of ideas! 
5.  <strong>Evil Venus:</strong> Appears so little, and has no importance so they're just a waste of a slot as there is nothing to think about him. 
6.  <strong>Enrike21:</strong> Just a Roblox character falling. It's boring, and lacks any of the personality or cleverness of other characters.
7.  <strong>Black Hole:</strong> A plain black circle with a blurry halo. It got eliminated for a reason – it's dull. It's just a shape. Not funny, not threatening. Next!
8.  <strong>SMB1 Luigi:</strong> He's a retro, pixelated Luigi, but what is his purpose to the story? What do they even have to offer. 
9.  <strong>Aldi:</strong> It's the logo of a supermarket. It's a store. It does not even show up later on in the videos and therefore it is useless. 
10. <strong>Goblin:</strong> A generic-looking historical figure with the word 'goblin' stamped over their face. It's lazy and uninspired. 
11. <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed:</strong> I can never understand anything. I do not care that they won season 1 and still do not think they're anything special. I think people just like them and think "OMG I need to vote for them!"
12. <strong>Rasmus Højlund:</strong> Okay, at least he's got personality and has character. 
13. <strong>Violator:</strong> Just an album cover. However, at least they give a brief intro. However, other than that the character is pretty useless.
14.  <strong>This Fucking Cat:</strong> It does have character to them, however they are just a cat.
15. <strong>Stickman:</strong> The main protagonist (kinda) but not as good as the other characters on here and lacks substance
16.  <strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong> It has some character, however it is still bland.
17.  <strong>Benchodistan:</strong> At least the character has a nice persona. 
18.  <strong>Stop Breathing:</strong> You could say more, as it is just a screenshot of some comments on YouTube. 
19. <strong>Cold Cow:</strong> The duo of the Cold Cow is actually pretty good, as without him he wouldn't be with his friend. 
20.  <strong>Coconut Elephant:</strong> A very nice character, and the twist that it can somehow make an obstacle course is really crazy and good. 
21.  <strong>Al Gore:</strong> The Host of this thing. He's basically the ringleader of all the nonsense.
22.  <strong>HappyManOfficial Being Scary:</strong> It is the best character here. 
23.  <strong>Penaldo:</strong>  The sidekick, is way more brutal which is way better. 
24.  <strong>Kanye West:</strong> It really gets people into this show, they're very energetic and has character. 
25.  <strong>Kamran Ibrahim Abdullah:</strong> Kamran is a great character and host, therefore he's the best and really ties in this show together

There you have it, an objective and honest assessment of these characters. Some of them were just terrible.</div>
