  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these football match results with a dose of unfiltered honesty:

•   <strong>Lithuania 2-2 Finland:</strong> Lithuania managing a draw against Finland? Color me mildly surprised. Finland is generally a more established footballing nation.

•   <strong>Albania 3-0 Andorra:</strong> No surprises here. Andorra is consistently one of the weakest teams in Europe, and Albania should be winning comfortably.

•   <strong>Bosnia 2-1 Cyprus:</strong> A narrow win for Bosnia against Cyprus isn't shocking, but it isn't the most convincing performance. Bosnia should be aiming for a larger margin.

•   <strong>England 3-0 Latvia:</strong> Expected. England should dominate a team like Latvia, anything less than a comfortable win would be an embarrassment.

•   <strong>Poland 2-0 Malta:</strong> Another predictable result. Poland should be winning with ease against Malta.

•   <strong>San Marino 1-5 Romania:</strong> San Marino scoring a goal is the most surprising thing here. They rarely manage to find the net. Romania winning by a decent margin is expected.

In summary, the only mildly surprising result is Lithuania drawing with Finland, and San Marino scoring against Romania. The rest are pretty standard fare.</div>
