  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal assessment you asked for, no sugarcoating:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Jordan Pickford:</strong> 5/10 - Prone to errors, lacks consistency. Not a world-class keeper by any stretch.

•   <strong>John Stones:</strong> 6/10 - Can play out from the back, but suspect defensively when truly tested.

•   <strong>Harry Maguire:</strong> 3/10 - A walking disaster. Slow, clumsy, and a liability in any high-pressure situation.

•   <strong>Kyle Walker:</strong> 7/10 - Pace is still there, but tactical awareness wanes. Past his prime.

•   <strong>Luke Shaw:</strong> 6/10 - Decent going forward, but defensively average. Can be caught out of position.

•   <strong>Jordan Henderson:</strong> 4/10 - Washed up. Slow, lacks creativity, and offers little in terms of defensive steel.

•   <strong>Jude Bellingham:</strong> 8/10 - A genuine world-class talent. Dynamic, skillful, and a leader. Only bright spot in this midfield.

•   <strong>Sergej Milinkovic-Savic:</strong> 7/10 - Talented and strong, but not a game-changer.

•   <strong>Declan Rice:</strong> 7/10 - Solid defensive midfielder, but limited in his passing range and creativity.

•   <strong>Bukayo Saka:</strong> 7/10 - Talented, direct, and a goal threat.

•   <strong>Marcus Rashford:</strong> 6/10 - Inconsistent and lacks the killer instinct of a top striker.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>Overall: 5/10</strong>

This team is a mess. A mix of overhyped English players, has-beens, and one or two genuine talents completely wasted in a poorly balanced setup. The defense is a catastrophe waiting to happen, the midfield lacks creativity and steel, and the attack is too reliant on individual brilliance. They would get absolutely destroyed against any top-tier team. This is mid-table mediocrity at best.</div>
