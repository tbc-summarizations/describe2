  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you asked for it, here's my brutally honest take:

•   <strong>Germany 3-0 Greece:</strong> Germany actually managed to score without needing a penalty? Greece is still living in 2004, apparently.

•   <strong>Switzerland 3-3 Turkey:</strong> A draw? Both teams are equally mediocre. Expect them to peak in the group stages and then disappear.

•   <strong>England 3-0 Ukraine:</strong> Typical England, overhyped and beating teams they should beat easily. Wait until they face a real opponent; they'll crumble.

•   <strong>Austria 0-1 Netherlands:</strong> Austria bottled it as always. Netherlands probably only won because the ref felt sorry for them.

•   <strong>France 5-2 Czechia:</strong> France finally decided to show up. Czech Republic is just a tourist attraction at this point.

•   <strong>Belgium 2-0 Poland:</strong> Belgium, forever the dark horse that never wins anything. Poland just exists to make other teams look good.

•   <strong>Italy 0-1 Spain:</strong> Italy played like they were already on vacation. Spain probably won because they were less boring.

•   <strong>Scotland 1-4 Portugal:</strong> Scotland's only goal was probably a fluke. Portugal still relies on Ronaldo to carry them, even if he's past his prime.</div>
