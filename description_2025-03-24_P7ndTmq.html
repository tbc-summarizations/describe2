  <h1>Description for Png-2.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest opinion of your avatar:

It's pretty generic and screams "new player." The head and face are the standard default, which is boring. The red t-shirt with that random graphic is a dime a dozen and looks like something you'd find on page 50 of the catalog. The black pants are just plain lazy, and the white shoes with the black stripes are trying too hard to be cool but fail miserably.

The headphones are the only thing that's slightly interesting, but they don't save the overall look. It's a basic, uninspired avatar that I wouldn't give a second glance to in a crowded game. Honestly, it looks like you just slapped some random items together without any thought. I'd give it a 2/10, maybe a 3 if I was feeling generous. You need to try harder.</div>
