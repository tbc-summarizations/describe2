  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on these songs:

1.  <strong>I Want Wind To Blow:</strong> This track is way too long. The intro drags on forever, and the vocals sound like someone gargling gravel. 3/10
2.  <strong>The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> Overhyped and pretentious. The lyrics are trying way too hard to be deep, and the melody is forgettable. 4/10
3.  <strong>The Moon:</strong> This song is just boring. The production is bland, and the songwriting is uninspired. 2/10
4.  <strong>Headless Horseman:</strong> Generic and predictable. The chorus is repetitive, and the bridge is completely unnecessary. 3/10
5.  <strong>My Roots Are Strong and Deep:</strong> Short and pointless. This track adds nothing to the album and could have easily been cut. 1/10
6.  <strong>Instrumental:</strong> Utterly forgettable. It sounds like elevator music. 2/10
7.  <strong>The Mansion:</strong> Overproduced and cheesy. The vocals are grating, and the lyrics are laughable. 3/10
8.  <strong>\[untitled]:</strong> Aptly named, as it's completely devoid of any identity. Another waste of space. 1/10
9.  <strong>(Something):</strong> Vague and uninteresting. The song never goes anywhere, and the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. 2/10
10. <strong>I'll Not Contain You:</strong> Annoying and shrill. The singer's voice is like nails on a chalkboard. 1/10
11. <strong>The Gleam, Pt. 2:</strong> More of the same. This track is just as boring and uninspired as the rest of the album. 2/10
12. <strong>Map:</strong> A meandering mess. The song lacks focus and direction, and the transitions are jarring. 3/10
13. <strong>You'll Be In the Air:</strong> Cheesy and saccharine. The lyrics are cloying, and the melody is nauseatingly sweet. 1/10
14. <strong>I Want To Be Cold:</strong> A lazy attempt at being edgy. The song is hollow and lacks any genuine emotion. 2/10
15. <strong>I Am Bored:</strong> Ironically, this song accurately describes how I feel listening to this album. 1/10
16. <strong>I Felt My Size:</strong> Nonsensical and pretentious. The lyrics are meaningless, and the music is equally devoid of substance. 1/10
17. <strong>Instrumental:</strong> Still unmemorable. It has no reason to exist. 1/10
18. <strong>I Felt Your Shape:</strong> Uninspired and dull. The song drones on and on without ever making a point. 1/10
19. <strong>Samurai Sword:</strong> Laughably bad. The lyrics are cringeworthy, and the music sounds like it was composed on a Casio keyboard. 1/10
20. <strong>My Warm Blood:</strong> An excruciatingly long and tedious slog. This song is a complete waste of time and energy. 1/10</div>
