  <div class="discord-text">(Verse 1)
Hurricane, a name that roared through the night
Bob Dylan sang his story, in shades of wrong and right
A revolutionary bum, some whispered with disdain
While others saw a hero, fighting through the pain

(Chorus)
But words like bullets, they fly and they sting
"A crazy nigger," the bitter truth they bring
In a world of black and white, where shadows twist and turn
Did justice truly blindfold, or did prejudice still burn?

(Verse 2)
No one doubted, he pulled the trigger's cruel release
But was it self-defense, or a moment of disgrace?
The system's gears were grinding, with biases untold
Another black man falling, a narrative centuries old

(Chorus)
But words like bullets, they fly and they sting
"A crazy nigger," the bitter truth they bring
In a world of black and white, where shadows twist and turn
Did justice truly blindfold, or did prejudice still burn?

(Bridge)
The song's a mirror, reflecting ugliness and shame
A reminder that our language can fuel the hateful flame
Can we dissect the message, without condoning the slur?
Or are we doomed to repeat the sins of yesteryear?

(Chorus)
But words like bullets, they fly and they sting
"A crazy nigger," the bitter truth they bring
In a world of black and white, where shadows twist and turn
Did justice truly blindfold, or did prejudice still burn?

(Outro)
Hurricane, the storm still rages in our minds
A battle over meaning, in these complicated times
Let's confront the discomfort, the anger and the fear
And strive for understanding, so history doesn't reappear.</div>
