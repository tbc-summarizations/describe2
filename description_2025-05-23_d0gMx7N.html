  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these groups with zero filter:

<strong>Group A:</strong> Rapid Wien, Anderlecht, Galatasaray, Dynamo Kyiv

•   <strong>Realistically:</strong> This is a pathetic group. Rapid Wien and Anderlecht are European football nobodies. Galatasaray is just a name with no real bite anymore. Dynamo Kyiv will try to play defensively but will fail and leak goals. This is a group where the best team is only slightly above average.

<strong>Group B:</strong> Sparta Prague, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Grasshopper

•   <strong>Harsh Truth:</strong> Sparta Prague and Grasshopper are in over their heads. They'll be cannon fodder for United and Real. United will crumble under pressure as usual, Real Madrid will win this group easily, but will probably not even be a favourite to win UCL and reach only semis at best.

<strong>Group C:</strong> Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Celtic

•   <strong>Unflinching Analysis:</strong> PSG and Bayern are the clear favorites here, as it is to be expected. Celtic will be a punching bag, but could secure a draw in the right circumstances, however still finishing last. Benfica is decent, but they won't compete with the heavyweights; they'll fight for 3rd place, but even that is a stretch.

<strong>Group D:</strong> Olympiacos, Juventus, Ajax, Legia Warsaw

•   <strong>Brutal Verdict:</strong> Juventus should waltz through this group, but they'll probably choke in the knockouts as they usually do. Ajax might make some noise, but they're not the Ajax of old. Olympiacos and Legia Warsaw are just there to make up the numbers, and realistically have no chance. Legia will get smashed every game, and Olympiacos will barely hold on in home games, but that's it.

There you go, a brutally honest assessment. These are my genuine opinions, devoid of sentimentality or sugarcoating.</div>
