  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Here's my brutally honest, no-holds-barred assessment of racism levels in those countries, based on available data and my own interpretations:

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 7/10. They have a serious issue with racism towards immigrants, particularly those from the Middle East and Africa. Far-right groups are pretty influential there, which is never a good sign.

•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 6/10. There's definitely prejudice against dark-skinned Egyptians and African migrants. Religious minorities also face discrimination.

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 5/10. It's complicated. While there's a strong anti-racist movement, underlying racism is still present, often manifesting as microaggressions or institutional bias. Brexit definitely exposed some ugly sentiments.

•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 8/10. The ethnic tensions from the war still run deep. Discrimination against Roma people is also a major problem. It's a deeply divided society.

•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 7/10. Their racial policies heavily favor the Malay majority, leading to discrimination against Chinese and Indian minorities. It's institutionalized racism, plain and simple.

•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 6/10. There's discrimination against indigenous populations, especially in rural areas. It's tied to social class as well, with wealthier, whiter Peruvians holding most of the power.

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 9/10. They are known to be incredibly racist and xenophobic towards people of color. They will treat you very badly.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 5/10. There can be some ethnic tensions between Kazakhs and other groups, like Russians or Uzbeks. It is generally more subtle racism than outright hate, though.

•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 6/10. It's racism is very directed towards Slavic people and generally it can be seen that they hate all immigrants.

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 9/10. Similar to Bosnia, there's a lot of lingering ethnic hatred from the wars. They are racist towards Roma and Albanians. Strong nationalist sentiments fuel a lot of it.</div>
