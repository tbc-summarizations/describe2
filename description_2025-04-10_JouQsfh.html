  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the ranking of the characters from the video, worst to best:

13.  <strong>Agar.io:</strong> I find this to be a total rip off. They pretend to be all mighty when it is just a mediocre design.

14.  <strong>Uami Bosim:</strong> This little bastard can't even count to 13 correctly he should be burned in hell.

15.  <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy:</strong> Ukraine president who is so weak compared to the Russian president to a point that some people think that this world isn't real.

16.  <strong>Emoji:</strong> The most bland character. They are so generic to a point that he is nothing but a prop.

17.  <strong>PLEASEUN_BANHENRY:</strong> An absolute retard trying to be handsome when they look like they have a disease from Minecraft

18.  <strong>United Airlines Flight 93:</strong> Why does he have to make 9/11 so depressing and is such a wimp.

19.  <strong>Apple:</strong> Not a fan. Way too generic. They always think they're better than everyone.

20.  <strong>Neshtek:</strong> A rich pigeon? Okay? At least it's something. 

21.  <strong>Meethexep:</strong> Enjoys myths. Decent.

22. <strong>Stickman:</strong> Just a stick figure, but not bad.

23. <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> At least Kazakhstan has some spunk, despite being so boring.

24. <strong>Dekoder:</strong> I'm digging Dekoder, but they should probably be more respectful of the host.

1. <strong>Venus:</strong> If you are into old guys then I understand why you would place him as your number 1.

I think that this should work for you.</div>
