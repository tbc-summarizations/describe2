  <div class="discord-text">This message from Callao is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to intimidate and exert control over a community. It's xenophobic, threatening, and uses vulgar language to try and sound tough. The "Boys" group sounds like a bunch of insecure thugs who can't stand the thought of outsiders possibly disrupting their little power structure. It's a blatant power trip, and their threats against "extranjeros" and anyone renting to them are disgusting. They should be ashamed of themselves, but I doubt they are; they're probably too busy congratulating themselves on their "toughness." Frankly, it's repulsive.</div>
