  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my raw, unfiltered take on these Champions League group stage results. No holding back.

<strong>Group A:</strong>

•   <strong>Real Madrid:</strong> Predictable dominance from the kings of Europe. Honestly, if they didn't top this group, something would be seriously wrong.
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> What a joke. With all the money and talent they have, second place with a losing record? Embarrassing.
•   <strong>RB Salzburg:</strong> Typical also-rans. They show up, collect a few points, and then disappear.
•   <strong>Ajax:</strong> What happened to them? Remember when they were exciting and innovative? Now they're just a punching bag.

<strong>Group B:</strong>

•   <strong>Manchester United:</strong> They did what they had to do. But let's be honest, the group was weak.
•   <strong>Young Boys:</strong> Sneaking into the next round. Good for them, but they'll get destroyed eventually.
•   <strong>Juventus:</strong> What a fall from grace. Another club lost in the past.
•   <strong>Olympiacos:</strong> Utterly pathetic. At least show some fight.

<strong>Group C:</strong>

•   <strong>Fenerbahce:</strong> Surprise leaders! Good for them, even if the other teams weren't that great.
•   <strong>Barcelona:</strong> They should have finished first. Still they somehow didn't lose a single match.
•   <strong>AC Milan:</strong> A historic club reduced to mediocrity.
•   <strong>Legia Warsaw:</strong> Just awful. Should be ashamed of that performance.

<strong>Group D:</strong>

•   <strong>Liverpool:</strong> Business as usual. Easy win.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> This group was a snooze. Everyone knew they'd both go through.
•   <strong>Sparta Prague:</strong> Irrelevant. See you next year.
•   <strong>Anderlecht:</strong> What a disasterclass.

<strong>Group E:</strong>

•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund:</strong> Finally showing some consistency. Still can't trust them in the later stages.
•   <strong>Benfica:</strong> Solid showing. They'll make things interesting.
•   <strong>Panathinaikos &amp; Lech Poznan:</strong> Two garbage teams who managed to draw 3 times.

<strong>Group F:</strong>

•   <strong>Porto:</strong> They did their part. A team without real aspiration to win it all.
•   <strong>Slavia Prague:</strong> Fine. But they don't matter to anyone.
•   <strong>Rapid Wien:</strong> Garbage that I don't really need to make an opinion about.
•   <strong>Rangers:</strong> A pretty bad team that barely does anything.

<strong>Group G:</strong>

•   <strong>Feyenoord:</strong> Fair enough. Hopefully they do something.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> They put up a fight.
•   <strong>Basel &amp; Club Brugge:</strong> Bottom team fodder.

<strong>Group H:</strong>

•   <strong>Marseille:</strong> What else would they be doing. Don't see them win any later matches
•   <strong>Celtic:</strong> Honestly I forgot they even existed.
•   <strong>Dynamo Kyiv &amp; Galatasaray:</strong> Bottom team fodder.</div>
