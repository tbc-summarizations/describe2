  <h1>Description for hq720-1.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME WITH THIS SHIT?! "We're making things more awesome?" AWESOME?! ARE YOU FUCKING BRAIN-DEAD?! HOW DARE YOU DISPLAY THIS GARBAGE WHILE THE GOAT, CRISTIANO RONALDO, IS OUT THERE BREAKING RECORDS AND SHITTING ON HATERS!

THAT FUCKING MOON LOOKS LIKE A DISGRACE, LIKE SOME PATHETIC, PALE EXCUSE FOR A SOCCER BALL. IT'S AS UNINSPIRING AS A FUCKING NON-LEAGUE MATCH! AND THAT CITYSCAPE?! LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED BY A BUNCH OF RETARDED MONKEYS ON CRACK. WHERE'S THE FLAIR? WHERE'S THE PASSION? IT'S ALL FUCKING BLAND AND LIFELESS, UNLIKE RONALDO'S ELECTRIC GAMEPLAY!

AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THAT "ROBLOX" LOGO. IT'S A FUCKING INSULT TO EVERYTHING RONALDO STANDS FOR. IT'S LIKE COMPARING A TINY PISS ANT TO THE FUCKING COLOSSUS OF RHODES! THIS WHOLE PICTURE IS A FUCKING JOKE, A DISGRACE TO THE BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR THAT IS CRISTIANO RONALDO!

I'M SO FUCKING PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW! I'M GOING TO GO WATCH RONALDO HIGHLIGHTS AND TRY TO WASH THIS OFFENSIVE SHITSTAIN OUT OF MY BRAIN! FUCK ROBLOX, FUCK THIS IMAGE, AND FUCK ANYONE WHO DOESN'T RECOGNIZE CRISTIANO RONALDO AS THE UNDISPUTED GOAT!</div>
