  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here's the brutal truth about this hypothetical Balkan Cup final:

<strong>Croatia will absolutely demolish Montenegro, probably with a scoreline like 4-0 or even 5-1.</strong>

Here's why I'm saying this so definitively:

•   <strong>Midfield Mastery:</strong> Modric, Kovacic, and Majer is a joke for Montenegro to face, their midfield will get bossed around and reduced to chasing shadows.

•   <strong>Defensive Incompetence:</strong> Montenegro's defence is shaky at best. Savic is past his prime. Kramaric and Perisic will have a field day tearing them apart. Barisic will be unstoppable.

•   <strong>Attacking Toothlessness:</strong> Mugosa and Krstovic are decent players, but against a Croatian defence that's usually well-organized, they won't get a sniff at goal.

•   <strong>Experience Gap:</strong> Croatia is loaded with players who've played in Champions League finals and World Cup semi-finals. Montenegro's players mostly toil in smaller leagues. The gulf in experience is massive.

•   <strong>Montenegro's Substitutes Are Irrelevant:</strong> There's no real game-changer on their bench. Jovetic is past his prime and injury-prone. The rest are journeymen at best.

In short, this would be a complete mismatch. Montenegro would park the bus, try to frustrate Croatia, and hope for a lucky goal. Croatia would eventually break them down, score a few, and cruise to victory. It wouldn't even be that close.

I have absolutely no sympathy for Montenegro, they will get destroyed.</div>
