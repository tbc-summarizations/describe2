  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on Cold Cow, that blocky Minecraft abomination in your object show:

<strong>Cold Cow: A Blockhead in the World of Object Shows</strong>

<strong>General Information:</strong> Cold Cow is a contestant on whatever ridiculous object show you've cooked up, seemingly for the sole purpose of existing as a Minecraft cow in a 2D world. His placement in the competition seems utterly random, and his strategic prowess is likely non-existent. He's there for the novelty, not for any actual competitive value.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong> Oh, the horror. Cold Cow is a straight-up Minecraft cow rendered in pixelated glory (or rather, misery). We're talking brown and white blocks haphazardly arranged to vaguely resemble a bovine creature. He's about as visually appealing as a poorly rendered 1990s video game character that has been updated to a modern game in this day and age. It's blocky, it's outdated, and it screams "I couldn't come up with a more creative design."

<strong>Personality:</strong> What personality? Cold Cow exudes the same level of emotional depth as an actual block of dirt. He's mostly a non-entity, shuffling around with a blank stare and contributing nothing of substance to the group dynamics. You might as well stick a brick in the show â€“ it would have the same impact.

<strong>Abilities:</strong> Based on his performance, Cold Cow's abilities are limited to... standing there. I guess he can also fall off ledges, as demonstrated by his unfortunate plummet. His contributions to challenges are minimal, if not entirely absent. He's not strong, he's not smart, and he doesn't seem to possess any special skills whatsoever. 

<strong>Overall Rating:</strong> Cold Cow gets a solid <strong>1/10</strong>. He's visually uninspired, personality-deficient, and utterly useless. He's the object show equivalent of filler content, a character whose sole purpose seems to be to pad out the cast list and drag down the overall quality of the show. Dump him in lava and move on.</div>
