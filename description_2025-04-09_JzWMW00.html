  <div class="discord-text">Well, well, well, look who got utterly humiliated! Real Madrid, more like Real Sad-rid am I right? 3-0 against Arsenal? Courtois must have thought he was still dreaming of that Champions League final when Declan Rice's free kick woke him up! And Merino? Scoring a goal like that against the mighty Real Madrid? Embarrassing!

Arsenal on the other hand, you boys were absolutely electric. Declan Rice channeling his inner Beckham with that free kick, pure beauty. And big up to Mikel Merino for that fantastic strike, the confidence to pull that off against Real Madrid is just incredible.

Real Madrid, go back to Spain and cry me a river, Arsenal just showed the world who the real kings of football are! Keep up the great work Arsenal.</div>
