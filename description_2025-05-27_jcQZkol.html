  <h1>Description for 22995.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this Kyzylzhar squad with the brutal honesty you requested.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Miroslav Lobantsev:</strong> 4/10. He's been around, but his performances are inconsistent. He makes too many errors and doesn't command the box well enough.
•   <strong>Vadim Petrov:</strong> 2/10. A backup at best, clearly not a first-team caliber keeper.
•   <strong>Dzhurakhon Babakhanov:</strong> 1/10. Probably just there to fill a spot on the roster. Unlikely to ever see significant playing time.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Bekzat Shadmanov:</strong> 3/10. Lacks the pace and physicality to be a reliable defender at a higher level.
•   <strong>Ilija Martinovic:</strong> 5/10. A slightly above-average defender for this league, but prone to lapses in concentration.
•   <strong>Anatoliy Kozlenko:</strong> 4/10. Average at best, lacks the technical ability to contribute much in possession.
•   <strong>Asilbek Asan:</strong> 2/10. Young and inexperienced, needs significant development to become a useful player.
•   <strong>Miras Eleukin:</strong> 3/10. Another young player who looks out of his depth.
•   <strong>Abdoul Aziz Toure:</strong> 5/10. A decent defender, but nothing special. Solid tackler but lacks positional awareness.
•   <strong>Aleksandr Lebedev:</strong> 3/10. Past his prime, lacks the pace and agility to compete.
•   <strong>Elisey Gorshunov:</strong> 2/10. A youth player who needs time to develop before being a first team player.
•   <strong>Andrey Vasiljev:</strong> 4/10. An experienced player that is not good enough for this team.
•   <strong>Dmitriy Miroshnichenko:</strong> 6/10. Is the most experienced defender and can be good at times.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Oleksandr Noyok:</strong> 6/10. Decent midfielder, can pass okay and tackle ok but isn't great at anything.
•   <strong>Rafael Sabino:</strong> 5/10. Average player, but not good enough in modern football.
•   <strong>Michelle Kao:</strong> 4/10. Not good enough and will likely not get any game time at all.
•   <strong>Andrey Ulshin:</strong> 3/10. Seems to be out of his depth and needs improving.
•   <strong>Samat Zharynbetov:</strong> 2/10. Probably only on the team to fill up the squad.
•   <strong>Arsen Buranchiev:</strong> 3/10. Unlikely to be anything in the future.
•   <strong>Madi Zhakipbaev:</strong> 2/10. Like Zharynbetov. Probably only on the team to fill up the squad.
•   <strong>Ruslan Valiullin:</strong> 6/10. Will do a decent job at CDM but is not spectacular at anything.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Darko Zoric:</strong> 6/10. Can provide a decent threat from set pieces and is a creative player.
•   <strong>Néné Gbamblé:</strong> 3/10. Useless and is too old to play at this level.
•   <strong>Senin Sebai:</strong> 4/10. Not really the best player.
•   <strong>Toktar Zhangylyshbay:</strong> 6/10. Decent player, but nothing spectacular.
•   <strong>Artem Cheredinov:</strong> 2/10. No goals and never will.
•   <strong>Gleb Valgushev:</strong> 2/10. Another player that is only there to fill up the squad.
•   <strong>Timur Muldinov:</strong> 3/10. Another striker that isn't going to do a good job at all.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

Considering the weaknesses in almost every position, the lack of real quality, and the overabundance of mediocre players, I'd give this Kyzylzhar squad a <strong>4/10</strong>. They're likely going to struggle to compete at a high level.</div>
