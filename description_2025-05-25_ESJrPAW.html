  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you want a roast of the 2024-25 Premier League season? Buckle up, buttercup, because here it comes.

<strong>Top of the Table</strong>

•   <strong>Liverpool (C):</strong> Congrats, you managed to win the league. Just don't let it get to your head, after all, the expectation was for you to win every trophy possible. Your title is as predictable as your fans complaining about referee decisions, which they didn't have too much to complain about given all the help you received.

•   <strong>Arsenal:</strong> Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. You bottled it again, didn't you? Another year of "almost" with no silverware to show for it. Just enjoy your yearly Champions League exit in the first knockout round.

•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> How the mighty have fallen. 3rd place? Did the oil dry up? Guess you can't just buy your way to the top every year. Maybe try investing in some actual defenders instead of more attackers.

•   <strong>Chelsea:</strong> Back in the Champions League, but at what cost? You spent more money than some countries' GDP, and all you got was 4th place and the reputation of being a financial joke. At least you can finally afford to get a decent striker next season.

<strong>The Mid-Table Mediocrity</strong>

•   <strong>Newcastle United:</strong> You finished 5th? Impressive, but let's be honest, it's probably a fluke. Enjoy your Europa League trophy before your sheikh buys another club and abandons you.

•   <strong>Aston Villa:</strong> Europa League? Good for you, you managed to finish above expectations for once. Just don't get too excited, you'll probably get knocked out in the group stage.

•   <strong>Nottingham Forest:</strong> Conference League play-off? Well done for a team of newly promoted players, although considering the league this year, it doesn't say much about your abilities. You'll be fighting relegation again next season, guaranteed.

•   <strong>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion:</strong> Always the hipster's choice, always the bridesmaid. You play nice football, but who cares when you finish mid-table? Enjoy your "expected goals" stats while other teams actually win things.

•   <strong>Bournemouth:</strong> Middle of the pack. Nobody really cares. At least you're not going down. Enjoy the small victories.

•   <strong>Brentford:</strong> You know what they say - 10th is just the beginning. You'll probably sell your best player and fade into obscurity next season, though.

•   <strong>Fulham:</strong> So average, so forgettable. You're the beige of Premier League teams. At least you managed to stay up, that's an accomplishment for you.

•   <strong>Crystal Palace:</strong> Winning the Europa League as 12th place is just downright embarrassing for the league, isn't it?

•   <strong>Everton:</strong> Somehow you managed to finish above relegation again. You're like a cockroach, impossible to kill. Enjoy your yearly battle against the drop, you masochists.

•   <strong>West Ham United:</strong> You won a trophy? Congrats, you must feel so happy winning the equivalent of an EFL trophy in Europe. Back to mediocrity you go.

<strong>The Relegation Zone and Beyond</strong>

•   <strong>Manchester United:</strong> Oh, how the mighty have fallen. 15th place? You're a disgrace to the sport. Maybe try spending less on marketing and more on actual players. You're closer to the Championship than you are to the top four.
•   <strong>Wolverhampton Wanderers:</strong> So bad you're almost irrelevant. Enjoy fighting Manchester United for the 16th place trophy next year.
•   <strong>Tottenham Hotspur:</strong> 17th place? Somehow you managed to get worse. You're the laughingstock of London. Enjoy your Champions League Trophy because you only managed to get it through the fair play rule after the winner was found guilty of multiple fraud charges.
•   <strong>Leicester City (R):</strong> From champions to the Championship. You had a good run, but all good things must come to an end. Enjoy the banter era.
•   <strong>Ipswich Town (R):</strong> You came, you saw, you got relegated. Back to the Championship you go, enjoy the taste of Premier League failure while you were here.
•   <strong>Southampton (R):</strong> What a pathetic performance. Two wins? You're an embarrassment to football. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

There you have it. A season of overpaid players, underperforming teams, and the same old faces at the top. Here's to another year of disappointment next season!</div>
