  <div class="discord-text">(Upbeat, quirky music starts)

(Verse 1)
Hey, check out this guy, hair like a Minecraft mountain!
Straight outta the RTX challenge, lookin' countain!
Skin so smooth, like a fresh block of butter
But that gaze? It's like, "I'm judging your gutter."

(Chorus)
Pixel Generation, what does that even MEAN?
Is it, like, we're all just screens?
Doknes, Doknes, what's the deal, man?
Trying to sell me something with this pixelated clan?

(Verse 2)
Minecraft RTX, yeah, it looks pretty nice
But are we really focusing on what's truly precise?
Like, the existential dread of blocky demise
Or the overwhelming urge to build a creeper's lies

(Chorus)
Pixel Generation, what does that even MEAN?
Is it, like, we're all just screens?
Doknes, Doknes, what's the deal, man?
Trying to sell me something with this pixelated clan?

(Bridge)
He's got that look, the influencer stare
Like he knows all the secrets, but doesn't really care
Just wants you to subscribe, hit that notification bell
And maybe buy some merch, what the hell?

(Chorus)
Pixel Generation, what does that even MEAN?
Is it, like, we're all just screens?
Doknes, Doknes, what's the deal, man?
Trying to sell me something with this pixelated clan?

(Outro)
Minecraft! RTX! Doknes!
(Music fades out with a "pling" sound)
What even WAS that? I'm so confused.
(Whispers) ...I kinda wanna play Minecraft now though.</div>
