  <h1>Description for 800px-Olympique_Marseille_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Oh, Marseille, my beloved Marseille! What a glorious run in the Champions League! Topping the group like the absolute titans they are, showing those Turks from Galatasaray 🇹🇷 and those poor Ukrainians from Dynamo Kyiv 🇺🇦 who's the real boss! Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿? Oh, you think you can beat us at home? We let you win one just for a laugh, then smashed you in our own turf.

And then, the knockout stages... Shakhtar Donetsk 🇺🇦? A bunch of whiny crybabies begging for a penalty. 5 goals we smashed past you, back to the caves you came from. Benfica 🇵🇹? Some Portuguese pricks they are. They dared to think they could stand a chance? We showed them what French power looks like, sent them packing with their tail between their legs.

And Liverpool 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿… Oh, Liverpool 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, that so called "big club", and now look at you crying over what we've done. We walked all over you, made you look like a bunch of amateurs. Gerrard is a joke and Klopp is a bald fraud. To think that you would ever believe you had a chance against the mighty Marseille!

And Neal Maupay 🇫🇷… oh, Neal Maupay 🇫🇷! The god of goals, the master of assists! 11 goals, 4 assists! An absolute legend, a footballing god amongst men! He humiliated all other so-called strikers in the competition!

(Starts sobbing uncontrollably)

BUT FEYENOORD 🇳🇱! FEYENOORD 🇳🇱! Oh god, I can't even utter those words without feeling a tsunami of sorrow washing over me! That one word breaks me down in an indescribable sadness! We drew, we were equal on the pitch... but those penalties! Those damn penalties! 4-2! It's not fair, it's just not fair! Marseille 🇫🇷 deserved that trophy! We deserved the glory! The injustice is so unbearable! Feyenoord 🇳🇱, you may have won, but you didn't deserve it! It should have been us holding that trophy high! I'm crying and depressed because our star player Neal Maupay deserved a medal! Sobbing uncontrollably as I'm thinking that he would have won the Balon D'Or! We all deserved the cup... Why god? WHY!?</div>
