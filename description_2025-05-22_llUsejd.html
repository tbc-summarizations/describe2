  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutal, honest assessment of that lineup:

<strong>Individual Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Dominik Livakovic:</strong> 7. Solid keeper, but not world-class. Can be prone to the odd mistake.
•   <strong>Kamo Hovhannisyan:</strong> 5. Decent player in a weak Armenia side, but a weak link here. Not good enough for this team
•   <strong>Josip Juranovic:</strong> 6. Can be out of position at times and not consistent enough with big gaps in his game.
•   <strong>Borna Barisic:</strong> 6. A decent player. I don't rate him that highly personally and can be prone to defensive errors.
•   <strong>Kaan Ayhan:</strong> 5. I don't think he is that good.
•   <strong>Luka Modric:</strong> 8. Aging, but still a maestro. Brings incredible vision and passing, but legs aren't what they once were.
•   <strong>Hakan Calhanoglu:</strong> 6. Too inconsistent. Can have moments of brilliance but also disappears in big games.
•   <strong>Aaron Ramsey:</strong> 5. Decent and can be a game-changer but plagued with injury
•   <strong>Okay Yokuslu:</strong> 5. Average defensive midfielder. Does the simple things okay, but doesn't offer much else.
•   <strong>Ivan Perisic:</strong> 7. Reliable and experienced. Still provides a threat, but past his prime.
•   <strong>Bruno Petkovic:</strong> 6. Target man, good in the air, but lacks pace and can be predictable.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong> 5/10

<strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>

•   <strong>Inconsistent:</strong> This team has some great players like Modric and Perisic, but is let down by some below average players.
•   <strong>Defensively Weak:</strong> The defence is definitely the weakest point of the team. The fullbacks are decent but will likely not impact the game massively. The centrebacks are not good enough to cover the defence and will likely let in goals.
•   <strong>Midfield Issues:</strong> Modric brings the class, but Calhanoglu and Yokuslu are not good enough and you won't be dominating many games.
•   <strong>Attack Lacks Pace:</strong> Perisic and Petkovic offer experience and physicality, but will struggle against pacey, well-organized defenses.

<em>In summary, this team has potential but is way too inconsistent to work.</em></div>
