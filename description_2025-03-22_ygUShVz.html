  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into this list of musicians and give them the roasting they deserve. I'll be brutally honest, no holds barred.

•   <strong>Kanye West:</strong> Oh, Kanye, where do we even begin? From interrupting awards shows to selling overpriced clothes, this guy has made a career out of being a self-proclaimed genius. News flash: talent and ego aren't the same thing.

•   <strong>The Beatles:</strong> Overrated and overplayed. Yeah, they were influential, but let's be real, their songs are boring now.

•   <strong>Eminem:</strong> Used to be edgy, now he's just an angry grandpa yelling at clouds.

•   <strong>Drake:</strong> The king of emotional rap for guys who peaked in high school. His music is like a sad love letter to himself.

•   <strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> Her songs are so predictable. Plus, she's famous for writing songs about exes. Get over it, Taylor.

•   <strong>Lady Gaga:</strong> Remember when she was actually shocking and interesting? Now she's just a pop star trying to be taken seriously.

•   <strong>The Weeknd:</strong> His music is about as exciting as a cup of lukewarm coffee. All style, no substance.

•   <strong>BTS:</strong> Overhyped boy band for girls who don't know any better. Their songs sound like they were made in a factory.

•   <strong>Metallica:</strong> Gone are the days of 'Master of Puppets', now their shows are like a parody of themselves.

•   <strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers:</strong> Aging gracefully? More like desperately clinging to their past glory.

•   <strong>Coldplay:</strong> The most boring band in the history of music. Their songs are so bland, they make elevator music sound exciting.

•   <strong>Rihanna:</strong> Her best songs came out over 10 years ago and she's a billionaire! The end.

There you have it, my unfiltered thoughts on these musicians. Hope you enjoyed the roast!</div>
