  <h1>Description for 1024px-Feyenoord_logo_since_2024.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm not holding back. This Feyenoord squad looks like a bunch of names thrown together with a sprinkle of potential and a whole lot of mediocrity.

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>
•   Justin Bijlow 7/10: Decent shot-stopper, but injury-prone. Not world-class.
•   Plamen Andreev 3/10: Who? Probably won't see the pitch.
•   Timon Wellenreuther 5/10: A backup. Enough said.
•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>
•   Bart Nieuwkoop 5/10: Just a rotational player; he is alright though.
•   Thomas Beelen 5/10: Average to mediocre.
•   Gijs Smal 7/10: Not awful.
•   Quilindschy Hartman 6/10: Solid.
•   Hugo Bueno 6/10: Ok.
•   Gernot Trauner 7/10: Getting old, but experienced.
•   Jeyland Mitchell 4/10: Unknown quantity. Probably not good enough.
•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   Quinten Timber 8/10: The only really good player in the squad, very decent midfielder.
•   Hwang In-Beom 7/10: Can do a job; has potential.
•   Ramiz Zerrouki 4/10: Nothing special. Not good enough.
•   Jakub Moder 6/10: Promising, but injury-prone.
•   Facundo Gonzalez 4/10: Not sure what to expect.
•   Luka Ivanusec 6/10: Can make something happen.
•   Antoni Milambo 3/10: Too young. Not ready.
•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>
•   Ayase Ueda 6/10: Alright.
•   Calvin Stengs 7/10: Potential.
•   Igor Paixao 7/10: Solid.
•   Julian Carranza 4/10: Nothing crazy.
•   Anis Hadj Moussa 5/10: Average winger.
•   Shiloh 't Zand 4/10: Too young.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 5.5/10</strong>

This is a mid-table squad at best. There are a few players with potential, but the overall quality is lacking. They desperately need more quality and depth if they want to compete at a higher level.

<strong>Chances of Winning:</strong>

•   <strong>Champions League: 0%</strong> - They wouldn't even make it out of the group stage, let alone win the whole thing. It's laughable to even consider.
•   <strong>Europa League: 10%</strong> - They might get a good run with some luck, but the squad isn't strong enough to beat the top teams.
•   <strong>Conference League: 25%</strong> - Their best shot, but still a long shot. They could make a decent run, but the chances of actually winning are still slim.

<strong>Final Verdict:</strong>

Don't get your hopes up, Feyenoord fans. This squad isn't going to win anything significant anytime soon. It's a rebuilding project, and they need to make some serious upgrades if they want to compete with the big boys.</div>
