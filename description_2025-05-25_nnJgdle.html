  <h1>Description for 800px-Arsenal_FC.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest rating of that Arsenal squad, individual players, and the team as a whole, based purely on my assessment:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Coach: Mikel Arteta (5/10):</strong> Hasn't proven he can consistently deliver top-tier results. Tactics can be questionable and often seems clueless when things go wrong.

•   <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>
•   <strong>Neto (4/10):</strong> Decent backup, but nothing special. A liability in high-pressure situations.
•   <strong>David Raya (7/10):</strong> A solid keeper, but not world-class. Prone to errors, not good enough to lift the team.
•   <strong>Tommy Setford (2/10):</strong> Untested and irrelevant at this point. Probably only plays in training.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>
•   <strong>Ben White (6/10):</strong> Overrated. Does the basics fine, but lacks flair and gets easily outplayed by even slightly skillful players.
•   <strong>Jurrien Timber (7/10):</strong> Promising, but still raw. Needs time to develop, likely injury prone.
•   <strong>Takehiro Tomiyasu (5/10):</strong> Inconsistent and injury-prone. Below average.
•   <strong>Gabriel (7/10):</strong> Decent defender, but makes too many mistakes.
•   <strong>William Saliba (8/10):</strong> One of the better defenders on the team, reliable and composed.
•   <strong>Jakub Kiwior (4/10):</strong> Not good enough for a top team. Average at best.
•   <strong>Kieran Tierney (5/10):</strong> Decent player, but injury prone and easily replaced.
•   <strong>Oleksandr Zinchenko (6/10):</strong> Good on the ball, but a defensive liability.
•   <strong>Riccardo Calafiori (7/10):</strong> Promising player. Has potential but needs to prove more.
•   <strong>Myles Lewis-Skelly (3/10):</strong> Too young to be a factor, still needs development.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   <strong>Jorginho (4/10):</strong> Past his prime. Offers little in terms of pace or creativity. Slow and ineffective.
•   <strong>Thomas Partey (6/10):</strong> Injury-prone. When fit, decent but unreliable. Overrated by Arsenal fans.
•   <strong>Martin Ødegaard (7/10):</strong> Good vision and passing, but lacks consistency. Disappears in big games.
•   <strong>Mikel Merino (7/10):</strong> A solid player, but not a game-changer. Average
•   <strong>Declan Rice (8/10):</strong> Good player, but overrated. Doesn't have the skill set to be world class.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>
•   <strong>Bukayo Saka (8/10):</strong> Talented but relies too much on his left foot. Prone to diving and theatrics.
•   <strong>Ethan Nwaneri (3/10):</strong> Too young to make a real impact.
•   <strong>Raheem Sterling (5/10):</strong> Past his prime. Inconsistent and lacks the killer instinct.
•   <strong>Leandro Trossard (6/10):</strong> Good squad player, but not a starter.
•   <strong>Gabriel Martinelli (7/10):</strong> Promising, but inconsistent and needs to improve his finishing.
•   <strong>Nathan Butler-Oyedeji (2/10):</strong> Irrelevant.
•   <strong>Gabriel Jesus (7/10):</strong> Good work rate, but lacks the clinical finishing needed in a top striker.
•   <strong>Kai Havertz (5/10):</strong> A flop. Lacks confidence and impact.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 6/10</strong>

<strong>Reasoning:</strong>

•   The squad is decent, but there are too many players who are either past their prime, inconsistent, or simply not good enough for a team that wants to win major trophies.
•   The defense has good players, but is not solid and prone to errors.
•   The midfield lacks a truly dominant force.
•   The attack has talent but needs more consistency and clinical finishing.
•   Arteta's tactical limitations and inability to motivate the team further drag down the rating.</div>
