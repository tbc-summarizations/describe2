  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest, no-holds-barred prediction for those European Championship groups:

<strong>Group A: Germany, Turkey, Switzerland, Greece</strong>

•   <strong>Germany:</strong> They'll bulldoze this group. Pure dominance. Expect nothing less than 9 points. Their squad is just on another level of technical skill, tactical discipline, and frankly, the sheer will to win. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional.
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> They'll make the last 16 as they will probably come second. They do not have a bad squad and they have very dedicated fans, so will be great atmosphere and energy, which will help them.
•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> Lucky if they get a third place. They might be good if they are lucky. They will just be lucky to get to the knockout rounds.
•   <strong>Greece:</strong> A complete joke. They were lucky to even qualify. They will probably be out in the group stages. Expect them to come last, they are probably the worst team there.

<strong>Group B: England, Netherlands, Austria, Ukraine</strong>

•   <strong>England:</strong> Overhyped. They will finish first but they are probably going to be one of the most disappointing sides. They will probably lose in the Quarter-Finals.
•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> They are coming second. Decent squad but way too inconsistent and their coach isn't the sharpest tactician. Expect a Round of 16 exit.
•   <strong>Austria:</strong> They will come third. They aren't making it into the round of 16 due to the other teams being stronger.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> They are the most annoying team in this group. Their fans are also bad. They will probably get knocked out in the group stage.

<strong>Group C: France, Poland, Belgium, Czechia</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> These guys are winning it all. The other teams in this group will get clapped by France. Top quality manager, top quality squad.
•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> They will qualify but there old stars aren't what they use to be, expect them to disappoint.
•   <strong>Poland:</strong> If Poland play like they are now, they will probably lose, but if they get their injured players back, then the team will be great.
•   <strong>Czechia:</strong> They will get absolutely smoked in the group stage. They are one of the most overrated teams.

<strong>Group D: Italy, Portugal, Scotland, Spain</strong>

•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> They are the team that will come first. Spain are on a decline and Scotland and Italy are too inconsistent to beat them.
•   <strong>Italy:</strong> They will make it into the knockout rounds, but they will disappoint as they are no where near as good as they were in the last one.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> As said before they will have a disappointing side. They will not make it past the quarter finals.
•   <strong>Scotland:</strong> Lucky to get 1 win.

There you have it. No sugarcoating, just pure, unadulterated football truth. If you don't like it, get better teams!</div>
