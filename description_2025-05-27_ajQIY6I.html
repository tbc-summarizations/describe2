  <h1>Description for 12019.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of Zhenis's squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Sergey Ignatovich:</strong> A Belarusian keeper in Kazakhstan? Probably past his prime. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Alisher Suleymen:</strong> Unknown quantity. Probably backup material. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Dinmukhammed Zhomart:</strong> Another unproven local. Doesn't inspire confidence. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Vladislav Saenko:</strong> Seems to be another backup keeper. <strong>2/10</strong>

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Zurab Tevzadze:</strong> Georgian defender – could be solid, could be a liability. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Krystian Nowak:</strong> Polish – might bring some stability. Still I am not sure about his quality, so <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ivan Saravanja:</strong> Bosnian – potentially decent, but needs to prove it. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Konstantinos Venizelou:</strong> Cypriot – could be another average signing. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Askhat Baltabekov:</strong> Local, probably not a top-tier player. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sagi Sovet:</strong> Another local. Again, probably not very good. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Matija Rom:</strong> Slovenian – might be okay. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sayan Mukanov:</strong> Yet another local. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Aldair Adilov:</strong> Looks to be there just to fill in some positions. <strong>2/10</strong>

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Islambek Kuat:</strong> Has some Kazakh international experience, so he should be the best player in midfield. <strong>7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Madi Khasein:</strong> No real idea about him. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Abai Zhunusov:</strong> See Khasein. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Gian Martins:</strong> Brazilian – could bring some flair. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Jakob Novak:</strong> Slovenian, can become a decent player. <strong>6/10</strong>

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Gonçalo Teixeira:</strong> Portuguese – could be a decent goalscorer. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ardak Saulet:</strong> Local – probably backup. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Aslan Adil:</strong> Another local. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Adílio Santos:</strong> Brazilian – could provide something unpredictable. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Dinmukhamed Karaman:</strong> Yet another local with bad statistics. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Erdon Daci:</strong> Seems to be one of the most decent forward options. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Nurbol Anuarbekov:</strong> Probably a waste of a spot. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Mika:</strong> Spanish. Could be somewhat decent. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Khamza Yakudi:</strong> See Anuarbekov. <strong>2/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 3/10</strong>

This squad looks weak, filled with mediocre foreign players and unproven locals. They might struggle to compete at any serious level. There's a severe lack of quality, and I wouldn't expect much from them.</div>
