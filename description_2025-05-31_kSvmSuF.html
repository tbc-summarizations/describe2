  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercup, because here's how these Round of 16 matches are <em>really</em> going to go down:

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 vs. Switzerland 🇨🇭:</strong> England will absolutely dismantle Switzerland. The Swiss will try to park the bus, but England's attacking force is too much. Score: 4-0 England. Switzerland's keeper will have a terrible game, letting in at least one howler.

•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 vs. Romania 🇷🇴:</strong> Belgium is going to walk all over Romania. Romania is a glorified pub team. Score: 5-1 Belgium. Romania's only goal will be a lucky deflection.

•   <strong>Hungary 🇭🇺 vs. Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> This will be an ugly, physical match. Croatia's aging squad will struggle against Hungary's youthful energy. Score: 2-1 Hungary in extra time. Croatia will whine about the refereeing after the match.

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹 vs. Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> Portugal's individual brilliance will be too much for Serbia's disorganized defense. Score: 3-1 Portugal. Ronaldo will score a penalty, even though he's clearly past his prime.

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 vs. Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Italy's tactical superiority will stifle Norway's attacking threat. Score: 2-0 Italy. Norway's star striker will be marked out of the game.

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> The Netherlands will dominate possession, but Sweden will be dangerous on the counter. Score: 2-1 Netherlands, with a late winner. Sweden's coach will blame the loss on bad luck.

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 vs. Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> This is the heavyweight clash. France's pace and power will overwhelm Germany's aging midfield. Score: 3-2 France in a thrilling match. Germany's fans will be in tears.

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸 vs. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Spain's tiki-taka will bore Wales to death. Score: 3-0 Spain. Wales will struggle to get out of their own half, and Bale is too old now to do anything.</div>
