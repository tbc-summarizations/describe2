  <h1>Description for 20250311_094045.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the racism levels of each character in that image, rated on a scale of 1 to 10000:

•   <strong>Tennis Ball (A):</strong> 1 - A tennis ball isn't inherently linked to any race or culture. Pretty much zero chance of racism here.
•   <strong>Robot Flower (B):</strong> 1 - Similar to Tennis Ball, this character is a robot, therefore it can't be racist.
•   <strong>Golf Ball (C):</strong> 1 - A golf ball doesn't have any connections to any race, so there's not even a theoretical possibility of racism.
•   <strong>TV (D):</strong> 1 - It's a television, a machine. It's incapable of forming racial biases or acting on them.
•   <strong>Grassy (E):</strong> 1 - I highly doubt a bunch of grass would be racist.
•   <strong>Basketball (F):</strong> 1 - The shape is not related to race.
•   <strong>Blocky (G):</strong> 1 - Once again, racism is not possible to come from a simple cube with a face.</div>
