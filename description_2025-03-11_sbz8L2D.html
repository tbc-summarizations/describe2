  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of how gay each emoji is, rated from 0 to 100:

•   <strong>😡 (Angry Face):</strong> 5 - Straight up aggression, could be anyone.
•   <strong>🥶 (Freezing Face):</strong> 10 - Maybe closeted? Trying too hard to appear stoic.
•   <strong>😱 (Face Screaming in Fear):</strong> 15 - Mildly dramatic, but mostly just scared.
•   <strong>🤮 (Face Vomiting):</strong> 2 - Definitely just ate something bad, not gay.
•   <strong>💀 (Skull):</strong> 0 - Dead people don't have sexual orientations.
•   <strong>😇 (Smiling Face with Halo):</strong> 25 - Could be a bit of a "goody-two-shoes" type.
•   <strong>🤯 (Exploding Head):</strong> 30 - Overthinking everything, a little bit dramatic.
•   <strong>😐 (Neutral Face):</strong> 5 - Too boring to be gay.
•   <strong>😂 (Face with Tears of Joy):</strong> 35 - Laughing hysterically, could be laughing at something gay.
•   <strong>😭 (Loudly Crying Face):</strong> 40 - Very dramatic and expressive.
•   <strong>😎 (Smiling Face with Sunglasses):</strong> 60 - Confident and carefree.
•   <strong>💣 (Bomb):</strong> 0 - Just a bomb.
•   <strong>🥺 (Pleading Face):</strong> 50 - A little manipulative, uses their tears, likely very gay.
•   <strong>❌ (Cross Mark):</strong> 0 - Just a cross mark.
•   <strong>✅ (Check Mark):</strong> 0 - Just a check mark.
•   <strong>🙄 (Face with Rolling Eyes):</strong> 70 - Sarcastic and dismissive, peak gay energy.
•   <strong>💔 (Broken Heart):</strong> 80 - Heartbreak is a universal experience, but this has a slight gay hint.
•   <strong>⁉ (Exclamation Question Mark):</strong> 90 - Very Extra
•   <strong>🤣 (Rolling on the Floor Laughing):</strong> 100 - This is basically the gayest emoji ever.</div>
