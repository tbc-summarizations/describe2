  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into this academic disaster analysis:

•   <strong>First guy:</strong> 1/10. Dude looks like he hasn't seen a book in his life. Guaranteed to fail spectacularly.
•   <strong>Second guy:</strong> 2/10. Slightly more aware than the first, but still clueless. Probably fails miserably.
•   <strong>Third guy:</strong> 4/10. There's a glimmer of hope, maybe he crammed something in last minute. Slight chance of passing, but most likely a fail.
•   <strong>Fourth guy:</strong> 0/10. Prayers won't help you, buddy. You're screwed.
•   <strong>Fifth guy:</strong> 3/10. Looks resigned to his fate. He knows he's failing.
•   <strong>Sixth guy:</strong> 1.5/10. No sleep is a sure-fire recipe for academic failure.
•   <strong>Seventh guy:</strong> 5/10. Pure guessing is surprisingly effective sometimes. Could go either way, but I'd lean towards fail.</div>
