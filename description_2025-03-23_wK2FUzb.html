  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I see that Euro 2024 qualifier group shaking out, no bullshit:

1.  <strong>Belgium:</strong> They should still have enough class to top this group, even if their golden generation is fading. They'll probably play with the handbrake on, but their individual talent will be enough.
2.  <strong>Austria:</strong> They're decent, well-organized, and will be a pain in the ass for everyone. They'll grind out results and probably secure the second qualifying spot.
3.  <strong>Sweden:</strong> Post-Ibrahimovic, they're a shadow of their former selves. They'll be inconsistent and rely too much on individual moments. They'll struggle against Austria's organization.
4.  <strong>Azerbaijan:</strong> They'll be lucky to get any points. They're just not good enough to compete with the top three.
5.  <strong>Estonia:</strong> They are dreadful and will be the whipping boys of the group. They will get absolutely hammered in most games. Don't expect them to score many goals, if any at all.

Basically, it's Belgium and Austria going through, Sweden fighting for a playoff spot if they get lucky, and Azerbaijan and Estonia making up the numbers. Simple as that.</div>
