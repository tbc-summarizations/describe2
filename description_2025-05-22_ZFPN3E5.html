  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest prediction for the UCL final:

<strong>Bayer Leverkusen's 4-3-3:</strong> Looks offensively potent on paper, but their defense will be their downfall. Hradecky is prone to errors, the defensive line is shaky, and Arthur is a liability at fullback. They will score, but they will concede more.

<strong>Atletico Madrid's 4-4-2:</strong> A typical Simeone team, solid defensively but lacks firepower. Oblak is still a world-class keeper. The midfield is a good blend of grit and creativity, but the attacking duo of Nino and Sorloth is underwhelming. They will frustrate Leverkusen, but will struggle to score.

<strong>Prediction:</strong>

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid will win 1-0.</strong> They will frustrate Leverkusen to no end.
•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen's attack will misfire.</strong> They will create chances, but Oblak will be unbeatable and they will be a frustrated attacking team.
•   <strong>The game will be a tactical battle.</strong> Expect a low-scoring, intense match decided by a moment of brilliance or a defensive error. Atlético Madrid's defensive steel will ultimately prevail.</div>
