  <h1>Description for my-image14.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on this tier list, the object show with the best cast is WAS, because they are at the top. Here are my thoughts on them:

•   <strong>Sans</strong> A great comedic character, I like his design
•   <strong>Cool Glasses</strong> I have no strong feelings about it, but I could see why people like it
•   <strong>Agar.io</strong> Can't say I am a fan, I think its mid
•   <strong>Smiley Face</strong> Bland and overused, they are not special
•   <strong>Freddy Fazbear</strong> I can't say much about this one as I have not watched the show they are from
•   <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> Hilarious, I am glad they got added to this show
•   <strong>Stickman</strong> They are fine I guess but I think this archetype can be boring if overused
•   <strong>Triangle</strong> He is really awesome, glad they put him here
•   <strong>Block</strong> Can't say I like it to much, a character like this can be annoying
•   <strong>Ukrainian Man</strong> I like them because of their accent

BFCS is pretty bad, there are way to many countries there which makes it pretty boring and not worth watching

BFCSA is a little better, but the characters are not that memorable

BFN is just terrible, half the characters are just weapons

I am not even gonna bother going lower as its clear they are just bad</div>
