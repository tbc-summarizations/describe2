  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because I'm not pulling any punches. Here's the brutally honest breakdown of your Marseille squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Geronimo Rulli:</strong> 6/10. He's decent, but prone to errors. Not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Jeffrey de Lange:</strong> 2/10. Clearly a backup. Not reliable if needed in a big game.
•   <strong>Ruben Blanco:</strong> 4/10. Another backup level keeper. You're screwed if Rulli gets injured.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Leonardo Balerdi:</strong> 6/10. Can be a solid defender on his day, but lacks consistency.
•   <strong>Quentin Merlin:</strong> 5/10. Average. Nothing stands out, could be easily exposed.
•   <strong>Luiz Felipe:</strong> 7/10. A decent signing, brings some experience and stability, but not world-class.
•   <strong>Ulisses Garcia:</strong> 3/10. Just not good enough for a team with ambitions.
•   <strong>Derek Cornelius:</strong> 3/10. Seriously? You're not winning anything with him in defense.
•   <strong>Pol Lirola:</strong> 5/10. Decent, but lacks the quality needed for a top team.
•   <strong>Michael Amir Murillo:</strong> 6/10. A reliable player, nothing too special but could be a good edition to the team.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg:</strong> 7/10. A solid player who would add strength and experience.
•   <strong>Amine Harit:</strong> 7/10. Can be a creative spark, but needs to be more consistent.
•   <strong>Geoffrey Kondogbia:</strong> 6/10. Physical presence, but limited technical ability.
•   <strong>Valentin Rongier:</strong> 6/10. Does the job, but lacks the quality to elevate the team.
•   <strong>Ismael Bennacer:</strong> 8/10. He is a very good player and one of the best in the team, can do many things well but will need support as well.
•   <strong>Adrien Rabiot:</strong> 7/10. Brings experience and a good all-round game, but can be frustratingly inconsistent.
•   <strong>Bilal Nadir:</strong> 3/10. Not ready for this level.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Neal Maupay:</strong> 4/10. A striker who doesn't score enough goals. Useless.
•   <strong>Amine Gouiri:</strong> 7/10. Has potential, but needs to step up and deliver more consistently.
•   <strong>Mason Greenwood:</strong> 8/10. Talented and dangerous but very controversial and needs a lot of support.
•   <strong>Faris Moumbagna:</strong> 5/10. Raw potential, but needs a lot of development.
•   <strong>Jonathan Rowe:</strong> 5/10. Raw potential, but needs a lot of development.
•   <strong>Luis Henrique:</strong> 4/10. Overrated and inconsistent. Waste of space.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 5.5/10</strong>

This squad is mediocre at best. There are a few decent players, but not enough quality, depth, or consistency to compete for any major trophies.

<strong>Chances of Winning a European Trophy:</strong>

•   <strong>Champions League:</strong> 0%. Absolutely no chance. They wouldn't even make it out of the group stage.
•   <strong>Europa League:</strong> 5%. Maybe, <em>maybe</em>, they could get lucky and go on a decent run, but they're more likely to be knocked out early.
•   <strong>Conference League:</strong> 10%. This is their best shot, but even then, they'd need a lot of luck and some major improvements to win it.

In conclusion, this Marseille squad is a mess. They need a major overhaul to have any hope of competing at the highest level. Don't get your hopes up, Marseille fans.</div>
