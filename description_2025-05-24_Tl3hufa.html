  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of this XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Robin Olsen (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 5/10. He's been inconsistent throughout his career and has some glaring mistakes in him.
â€¢   <strong>Ken Sema (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 4/10. Not a natural defender. He's too slow and lacks the defensive awareness needed at this level.
â€¢   <strong>Ludwig Augustinsson (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 6/10. Decent but nothing spectacular. He's prone to errors.
â€¢   <strong>DÃ¡vid Hancko (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°):</strong> 7/10. He is a good defender that would be in a bigger club if he was more athletic and had a better passing range.
â€¢   <strong>Alexandru Chipciu (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´):</strong> 5/10. Too aggressive and inconsistent.
â€¢   <strong>Isaac Price (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§):</strong> 5/10. Unproven at the top level. He's a big unknown.
â€¢   <strong>Nicolae Stanciu (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´):</strong> 6/10. Can be creative on his day, but lacks consistency.
â€¢   <strong>Dejan Kulusevski (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 7/10. Decent but not as clinical as a striker would be in this position.
â€¢   <strong>Enis Bardhi (ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡°):</strong> 6/10. A good player when playing in North Macedonia's national team but his performances are average when he plays abroad.
â€¢   <strong>Bojan Miovski (ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡°):</strong> 6/10. Decent goalscorer, but lacks the pace.
â€¢   <strong>Viktor GyÃ¶keres (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 7/10. He has a great presence on the pitch.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5/10</strong>. This team would struggle against any team in any of the major European leagues. The defense is especially weak, and the midfield lacks both creativity and defensive stability. Up front, there's some potential.</div>
