  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a comprehensive essay on Violator, covering the requested aspects:

<strong>Violator: An Analysis of the Album Object</strong>

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Violator is a contestant in the object show, making its debut as a contestant in the series. Its name derives from the Depeche Mode album of the same name, which is also a depiction of his face in the object show.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Violator's appearance is a direct reference to the cover artwork of the Depeche Mode album "Violator." It's a stylized depiction of a single red rose with dark green leaves set against a stark black background. The overall image is stark and slightly melancholic. The rose is not overly detailed, but its general form is recognizable.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Violator projects an air of mellow indifference. He appears calm and collected, not one to get ruffled by the intensity of the competition. Its actions convey a sense that it's above petty squabbles and power plays, seemingly content to let events unfold without getting overly invested.
Despite its outwardly chill attitude, Violator has a deep sense of anxiety, fearing that his teammates will not see him as capable as others. 

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

Violator’s abilities remain largely unproven and untested.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Violator seems to be a good contestant to stay in the game for a little while, however they don’t have the winning energy that would make me think that they will last long. I’ll give it a 5/10, because of its coolness.</div>
