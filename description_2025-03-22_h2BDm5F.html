  <h1>Description for RPReplay_Final1691061087_1.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">In this bizarre animation, we see a yellow "X" character and a blue "4" character goofing around, pretending to fly with a "magic wand" given to the "4" character by "Harry." They are then joined by a smiling balloon and a cloud character in the sky. Everything seems to be going well, but as the yellow character gets close to the edge of a cliff, a green sea monster chomps down on their leg. The "4" character tries to save them, but the yellow character is bitten, and urinates in the monster's mouth because they can't hold on anymore. The sea monster expresses how yucky this is, and the animation ends.</div>
