  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into Benchodistan, the contestant from this object show. I'll break it down as requested:

<strong>General Information:</strong>
Benchodistan, as the name suggests, is a flag representing the state of Benchodistan. He is a contestant on a show where people compete.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>
Benchodistan's form is, quite simply, a flag. Its colors consist of a blue triangle, a red horizontal line and a black horizontal line, resembling the actual flag of a made up country named Benchodistan. He has two eyes and a mouth, allowing it to be able to express itself.

<strong>Personality:</strong>
I can’t describe a personality because no audio or actions were taken to display it. But I imagine it wouldn't be very interesting. Flags aren't exactly known for their dynamic personalities.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>
As the clip suggests, Benchodistan isn’t equipped with any particular abilities.

<strong>Rating:</strong>
Honestly, Benchodistan seems like a throwaway character. With that said, there is nothing to dislike about him. A solid 2/10 - exists and isn't offensive, but not much else to say.</div>
