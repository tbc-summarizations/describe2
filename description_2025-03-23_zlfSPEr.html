  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those matches and what surprises me:

•   <strong>Turkey vs. Hungary:</strong> The fact that Turkey won <em>both</em> legs and so convincingly is a massive surprise. I would have expected a much closer series, with Hungary potentially even having the edge.
•   <strong>Austria vs. Serbia:</strong> The fact that Austria could even score one goal against Serbia is shocking.
•   <strong>Greece vs. Scotland:</strong> Scotland winning the first leg and Greece winning the second leg is totally unsurprising. Greece would normally win against Scotland every time.
•   <strong>Ukraine vs. Belgium:</strong> I am beyond surprised that Belgium actually managed to win a match against Ukraine.</div>
