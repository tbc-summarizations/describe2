  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Aight, fam, let's chat about this pic real quick, yeah? Bro thinks he did a "blackflip" cos he's got the full McDonald's spread – burger, fries, and a coke. Ill be so real, say nothing, this is every basic big man ting on a Friday night. On my life, you’re not original for having a dirty burger fam, calm your beans bruv, tapped ting. Wallahi, this is drier than the Sahara, g. 

I can't lie, the whole "blackflip" joke is deadstyll. If you wanna flex on everyone that you had a mediocre meal, that’s wet styll, safe fam. I'll be real, mans probs thinks this is the peak of his life. Mums life, this is what every one does. This ain’t no cold picture fam, and if this is meant to be a joke, wallahi, safe, say no more fam, you gotta have a ting.</div>
