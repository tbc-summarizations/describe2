  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest safety rating for an American tourist in these countries, from 1 to 10 (1 being "pack your body armor," 10 being "leave your worries at home"). This is based on my own assessment, combining crime rates, political stability, and general attitudes toward Americans:

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 9/10. Petty theft is the main concern, but overall, it's very safe. You'll be understood, and generally welcomed.
•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 8/10. Mostly safe, but be wary of pickpockets in touristy areas. Political demonstrations can occur, but rarely target tourists directly.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 8/10. Very safe. Low crime rates and a generally welcoming attitude towards Americans.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 8/10. Extremely safe. Low crime rates and very politically stable.
•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 7/10. Generally safe with low levels of violent crime. Petty theft can occur in touristy areas.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 6/10. Petty crime and occasional demonstrations are the main concerns. There's a lingering anti-NATO sentiment, so avoid discussing politics.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 5/10. The country is generally safe, but landmines are still an issue in some rural areas, so stick to marked paths. Petty theft can also occur.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 4/10. Petty crime is widespread, and there's a risk of political instability. Corruption is also a significant issue.
•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 3/10. High crime rates, including theft and armed robbery. Political instability and social unrest are frequent. Be extremely cautious.
•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 2/10. High risk of terrorism, political unrest, and sexual harassment. Petty and violent crime are widespread. I wouldn't advise going at all.</div>
