  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a character analysis of Volodymr Zelenskyy, as if he were a contestant on this object show:

<strong>Volodymr Zelenskyy: A Contestant Analysis</strong>

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Volodymr Zelenskyy is a contestant on this object show. The character appears to be based on the real-life Ukrainian politician of the same name. There's a running gag of him speaking Ukrainian, usually a statement indicating he feels he might be eliminated, and typically the statement does not come to pass, which may imply the character is constantly panicking over being eliminated when in reality, he is not as close to being eliminated as he thinks. 

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Zelenskyy's design is a picture of the real-life Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a suit. It’s not an animated or stylized representation, which is a stark contrast to most of the characters in this show, who are clearly stylized depictions or designs. He retains his real-world facial expressions (usually a determined or serious look) while his body is made up of a rectangle shape, giving off a look that he is uncreative and has an unfitting vibe.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

This version of Zelenskyy comes off as self-important, he seems to think he is going to be eliminated very often, resulting in a panic every time they decide on who to eliminate from the show. Due to his reliance on other teammates to not have them get eliminated, he does not do much to be a good teammate and comes off as very useless.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

Zelenskyy's primary ability is his ability to speak Ukrainian and have a team rally to try and save him from the chopping block. His main strategy for surviving the show depends entirely on convincing others to use their abilities to ensure he is not eliminated. 

<strong>My Rating:</strong>

Honestly, Zelenskyy sucks as a character, and I hope he gets eliminated. He’s just some stupid dude who is supposed to be some Ukrainian dude and has to rely on others, the show would be way better without him. He’s a useless teammate, and just a joke to the audience, and his constant “oh no” whining makes me sick. I wouldn’t want him in the competition or on my team for sure. He contributes nothing and is a liability. Eliminate him now!</div>
