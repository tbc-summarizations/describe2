  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a brutally specific AI image generation prompt, designed to strip away everything but the background from the original image:

<strong>Prompt:</strong>

"Create an image that EXACTLY replicates the background of the Kanye West album cover 'Graduation,' but with ALL other elements REMOVED.

•   <strong>Focus:</strong> The background sky, clouds, and color gradient are the SOLE subject of the image.
•   <strong>Exclusion:</strong> ABSOLUTELY NO Kanye Bear, graduation caps, architectural structures, or any other character or object from the original album art should be present.
•   <strong>Clarity:</strong> The resulting image should be a clean, uninterrupted view of the sky as it is depicted in the album artwork, with the color palette and cloud formations faithfully reproduced.
•   <strong>Specificity:</strong> Replicate the exact color gradient from the original background, from the lighter tones at the bottom to the darker purples and violets at the top. Capture the subtle texture and shapes of the clouds as they appear in the album art.
•   <strong>Negative Prompt:</strong> Absolutely no cartoon-like characters, no buildings, no bears, no hats, no floating objects, no text, no album art references other than the color scheme and cloud patterns. The image is of a sky only."</div>
