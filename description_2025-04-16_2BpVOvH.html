<strong>Goblin: An Analysis</strong>

Goblin is a contestant from "Battle For Nirrous." He is one of the first contestants revealed to be safe from elimination in episode 1.

<strong>External Appearance</strong>

Goblin's external appearance is jarringly out of place and low effort. He is depicted as a black and white photograph of an old man with the word "Goblin" plastered over his eyes. It's as though the creator just grabbed the first obscure picture they could find and slapped a label on it.

<strong>Personality</strong>

Because of his short screentime, we have no clue on what his personality is. It's possible that Goblin is just not as interesting or that the creators don't know what to do with him.

<strong>Abilities</strong>

Goblin displays no special abilities. He's just there.

<strong>Rating</strong>

Goblin is awful. I couldn't care less about him. He's literally just a picture of some guy with the word "Goblin" on him. I'd like to see him leave quickly. He needs more development before I even consider liking him. He gets a 1/10 from me, only because it isn't possible to give him a 0.</div>
