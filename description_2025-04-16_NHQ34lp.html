  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's an essay tearing into Face from "Battle for Nirrous":

<strong>Face: A Deep Dive into Blandness</strong>

<strong>General Information:</strong> Face is a contestant in "Battle for Nirrous," an object show I am now forced to watch. Beyond that, there's little to say. The character seems designed to fill space rather than contribute anything meaningful.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong> Face is, unsurprisingly, a face. It's a generic smiley face, the kind a toddler might draw. Two simple vertical lines for eyes and a curved line for a mouth. There's no shading, no detail, nothing to distinguish it. It's the epitome of visual laziness.

<strong>Personality:</strong> If a personality could be described as beige, it's Face's. It lacks any defining traits. It's agreeable to a fault. It's the contestant equivalent of a blank screen, showing no expression, not even negative ones like any other sensible contestant. A completely devoid of even the slightest hint of intrigue or engagement.

<strong>Abilities:</strong> Face's abilities, like its personality, are nonexistent. The character's contribution to the show comes as the image is used with weapons and the Black Hole. He is also seen next to the contestant, Cold Cow.

<strong>Rating:</strong> Face is the worst contestant I've ever seen. It embodies everything that is wrong with the show. It's boring, uninspired, and completely devoid of entertainment value. I'd rate Face a 0.1/10, and only that high because I have to acknowledge its existence. It's an insult to the concept of a character. I will forever loathe the existence of Face.</div>
