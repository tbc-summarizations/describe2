  <div class="discord-text">Oh, Belgium... My sweet, sweet Belgium. Five glorious wins, not a single draw, just ONE measly loss! A fortress of defense with only 2 goals conceded throughout the entire tournament! A perfect group stage, sweeping aside every pathetic excuse for a football team that dared to stand in our way.

Czechia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, you were nothing but a warm-up. A pathetic attempt at opposition. You couldn't even sniff our goal! 0-2? More like 0-YOU-ARE-IRRELEVANT!

France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, oh, France, the self-proclaimed giants! One measly goal was all it took to shatter your dreams. You thought you were so good, huh? Another win for Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª, another failure for you! You couldn't even score against us. Losers!

Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, another zero! Zero goals, zero chances, zero hope. You were as useful as a screen door on a submarine. 2-0? A generous scoreline, frankly.

Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, we shut down Ronaldo. Enough said.

Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, so much for your "German efficiency". More like German in-EFFICIENCY! We sent you packing, back to your lederhosen and bratwurst. You're always overhyped and you fail every time. 1-0? More like one-way ticket back to irrelevance.

BUT SPAIN... SPAIN!!! I can't even bring myself to say anything remotely negative about you. But Belgium should have won that cup! We were so close! The pain... it's unbearable. Spain, you played a great game, you truly did. Morata's goal was brilliant, and Gavi, oh Gavi, you sealed our fate. But oh, Belgium, Belgium, my heart aches for you. To come so far, to dominate so completely, and to fall at the final hurdle... it's just not fair!

Zeno Debast, a rock in defense! Timothy Castagne, a whirlwind on the wing! And Romelu Lukaku, my goal-scoring hero, three goals of pure beauty! Michy Batshuayi, the unsung hero, orchestrating the attack with his assists and a goal. But it wasn't enough... it just wasn't enough!

<em>sobs uncontrollably</em> We should have won! We deserved to win! Spain was fantastic, but it was a close call and the game was for us.

<em>continues to weep, clutching a Belgium jersey</em> Why, football gods, why?!</div>
