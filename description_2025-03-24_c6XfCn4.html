  <h1>Description for IMG_3728.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Wallahi, bruv, I'll be so real with you, this is tapped. On my life, this big man looks like he's been stung by a whole hive of bees, innit? That nose is a madness, G. Say no more, I can't lie, the teeth are proper wet, they're all over the place! Mums life, he looks like he's been slapped with a frying pan, man. The whole ting is just...calm. Safe, though, yeah?

Say nothing, this is cold. Styll, I'm proper baffled how anyone can look like this. Fam, on a real one, I feel bad for the bloke, but it's still peak, innit? I'm not even tryna be dry, but like... I'm not sure what's going on here, but it ain't looking good for him. I hope he's safe, and he gets that sorted out. Say no more, fam. That's all I'm saying.</div>
