  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here is a detailed description of the attached media file:
The video is a recording from a security camera dated 18/10/2019 showing a man in a backyard with two dogs. The man is wearing a light blue short sleeved shirt and blue jean shorts with flip-flops. He appears to be playing with something small and red in his hands. He takes a few steps back, winds up, and throws what seems to be an explosive, most likely a firecracker, into a dug up hole in the ground which immediately detonates, sending debris and dirt everywhere. The dogs begin to run around as the man watches in shock and the video comes to an end.</div>
