  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these artist summaries with my brutally honest opinions:

<strong>Kanye West:</strong>

•   <strong>AoTY:</strong> The College Dropout is a solid start, but his ambition was still brewing.
•   <strong>RyM:</strong> <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> is overrated. It's a chaotic mess that people pretend to understand.
•   <strong>Spotify:</strong> <em>Graduation</em> aged like milk. It's basic and uninspired compared to his other work.
•   <strong>AoTY Songs:</strong> <em>Donda</em> is a bloated and unfocused collection of tracks.
•   <strong>RyM Songs:</strong> Again, <em>MBDTF</em> is just too much. Overproduced and exhausting.
•   <strong>Spotify Songs:</strong> <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em> is where he lost the plot and started his descent into pretentiousness.
•   <strong>Critics:</strong> Critics suck, but they got it right that <em>MBDTF</em> is a "masterpiece" which is cringe
