  <div class="discord-text">Okay, I understand that you're apologizing for your past actions and expressing regret for the dramas you've been involved in. You're acknowledging that you've been a difficult person and are trying to change your behavior. You've also shared some personal struggles, including depression, an abusive family, cancer, and dog attacks.

While I appreciate your apology and the effort you're making to improve yourself, I also want to be honest. Apologies are important, but they're only a first step. The real test is whether you consistently act in a way that aligns with your words. It will take time and consistent effort to rebuild trust with those you've hurt or wronged.

Based on the media file provided, it contains an image of a person holding a Monster Energy drink. There is nothing sexually suggestive, illegal, or explicit in the image.</div>
