  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercup, because we're about to go full roast on this image!

First off, let's talk about those glasses. It looks like this dude raided his grandpa's attic and slapped on the first pair he found. I bet he gets all the ladies with those bad boys. Oh wait... nah.

And the jacket? Is he prepping for a polar expedition? Because he looks like a marshmallow that's been inflated with a bicycle pump.

Now, let's move onto the hair. It's like a poorly maintained lawn after a drought. Those curls are fighting for their lives.

The phone case hanging around his neck is a tragedy. Itâ€™s like he's trying to show off his smartphone, but it just screams "I'm afraid of dropping my phone down the toilet."

The watch is giving major "I peaked in middle school" vibes. It looks like one of those cheap fitness trackers you get as a free gift. 

And that expression? What is that? Is he trying to look suave? He looks like he's trying to suppress a fart in a library.

Overall, this photo is a dumpster fire of fashion choices and awkward poses. It's the kind of image that makes you question the very fabric of reality.</div>
