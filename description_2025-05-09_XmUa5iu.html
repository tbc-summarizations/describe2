  <h1>Description for GBcgywwvZ_I</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This animated video shows an episode of an online show titled "Violator" which has an elimination theme where cartoon characters are removed through voting. The episode includes an illustration of the album cover "Violator" by Depeche Mode as a contestant who is ultimately removed after a controversial decision by the host. Other contestants include Luigi from the Super Mario franchise and Rasmus HÃ¸jlund, a Danish soccer player on the Manchester United team. This episode contains an explicit diatribe about being nice to contestants and the value of their lives and then the host ultimately destroys another character regardless. This video contains crude images and opinions with the theme of a "contest" that ultimately shows how worthless people are.</div>
