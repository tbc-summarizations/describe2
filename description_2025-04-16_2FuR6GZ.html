  <h1>Description for BattleForNiggas3.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutal take on Strawberry Meeth's Cousin from "Battle For Nirrous":

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Strawberry Meeth's Cousin is a contestant in this bizarre object show. Beyond that, there's not much to say. He seems to be a random addition that doesn't add much value to the show. I see him as a character that is just there for the sake of it.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

He's a strawberry with a cat head crudely photoshopped onto him. It's lazy and ugly. The whole design lacks any creativity or effort. It looks like something a child would make in 5 minutes on MS Paint. 

<strong>Personality:</strong>

This thing doesn't even have a personality. The creator did not even try to at least put some effort in making it, as such it is only there to be used.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

We are led to believe that this character is incapable of doing anything. It is completely worthless, especially when others in the show are fighting on top of him. What a waste of space.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

0/10. This character is a waste of space and a detriment to the show. The design is lazy, the personality is nonexistent, and the abilities are worthless. The creator should be ashamed of themselves for even including this abomination in the show. This character is an insult to object shows everywhere.</div>
