  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's my brutally honest take on these Champions League Round of 16 first legs:

•   <strong>Real Madrid 1-0 Young Boys:</strong> Seriously? Real Madrid scraping by against Young Boys? They're practically begging for an upset. Second leg: Young Boys will lose but they'll make Madrid sweat more than they should. Real Madrid advances (barely).

•   <strong>Fenerbahce 2-2 Bayern Munich:</strong> Honestly, a draw is a victory. Bayern Munich needs to wake up. Second Leg: Bayern will win without much hassle.

•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Slavia Prague:</strong> Dortmund actually delivered? Color me surprised. I still don't trust them not to bottle it. Second leg: Dortmund will advance.

•   <strong>Feyenoord 2-0 Celtic:</strong> As a dutch person, I love Feyenoord. Second leg: Celtic is going out.

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 Manchester United:</strong> Another 1-0 snoozefest. United is a joke, and PSG is just coasting. Second leg: PSG will score early and end the dreams for United.

•   <strong>Barcelona 1-0 Liverpool:</strong> Two giants past their peak stumbling around. This tie could go either way. Second leg: Barcelona wins it.

•   <strong>Benfica 1-1 Porto:</strong> A snoozefest. Second leg: Porto wins it.

•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk 3-2 Marseille:</strong> Entertaining, but who cares? The winners will still lose in the next round. Second leg: I don't care.</div>
