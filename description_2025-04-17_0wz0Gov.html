  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here’s your essay on Rasmus Højlund:

<strong>Rasmus Højlund: A Profile</strong>

Rasmus Højlund is a contestant on this object show. While not much is known about his backstory within the show's universe, he's presented as a Danish striker with high ambitions. 

<strong>External Appearance</strong>

Rasmus Højlund appears to be a direct representation of the real-life footballer, Rasmus Højlund. He’s a photorealistic rendering of the Danish striker, often depicted in his Manchester United or Denmark national team kits.

<strong>Personality</strong>

Rasmus is introduced as a cocky and confident competitor. He openly states that he will win the entire competition for Denmark. He doesn't hesitate to express his goals and assert his dominance, even though he doesn't have an actual power and it's just a soccer player's image stuck in a show about shapes.

<strong>Abilities</strong>

Within the show, Rasmus hasn't demonstrated any extraordinary abilities. He's portrayed as just the image of the soccer player. He doesn't have any actual powers.

<strong>Rating</strong>

Rasmus seems like an annoying guy with overconfidence. All he does is yell that he will win and do nothing. What's even worse is that he's a photorealistic soccer player when other characters are original shapes. What a lame character.
Rating: 2/10</div>
