  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because nobody is safe here:

•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg 0 - Brest 4</strong>: Salzburg? More like Sad-zburg! Getting thrashed at home by Brest? Maybe stick to energy drinks, because football isn't giving you wings. Brest, good on you for pulling off an upset, but let's be real, it's probably the highlight of your entire season.

•   <strong>VfB Stuttgart 1 - Sparta Prague 1</strong>: A draw? How thrilling. Stuttgart, still living in the shadow of your glory days, huh? And Sparta Prague, congratulations on managing to not lose to a team that's barely relevant anymore.

•   <strong>Arsenal 2 - PSG 0</strong>: Arsenal is actually good for once, maybe they should rename to Arsewin. PSG choked against a real team. Guess the Qatari oil money can't buy you grit.

•   <strong>Leverkusen 1 - Milan 0</strong>: Leverkusen wins? Is the Bundesliga turning into Serie A? Milan, seriously, what happened to Italian football? Oh yeah, I forgot you have like no money.

•   <strong>Dortmund 7 - Celtic 1</strong>: Dortmund decided to play a real team and they destroyed them. Celtic is garbage in Europe as always.

•   <strong>Barcelona 5 - Young Boys 0</strong>: Barcelona beat up on a team of farmers. Did you really think you had a chance?

•   <strong>Inter Milan 4 - Red Star Belgrade 0</strong>: Inter flexing their muscles against a team nobody cares about. Red Star, enjoy the participation trophy.

•   <strong>PSV 1 - Sporting CP 1</strong>: A snoozefest draw that nobody watched and nobody will remember. Both teams are mediocre.

•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava 0 - Man City 4</strong>: Slovan got murdered as expected, they were never on Man City's level.

•   <strong>Shakhtar 0 - Atalanta 3</strong>: Shakhtar Donetsk got absolutely owned. Atalanta is the Italian team to actually watch at the moment.

•   <strong>Girona 2 - Feyenoord 3</strong>: Feyenoord manages to scrape by against Girona.

•   <strong>Aston Villa 1 - Bayern Munich 0</strong>: Aston Villa has had a major glow up and Bayern bottled it against them.

•   <strong>Dinamo Zagreb 2 - Monaco 2</strong>: Another meaningless draw. Are these teams even trying?

•   <strong>Liverpool 2 - Bologna 0</strong>: Liverpool are back to cooking and Bologna are still irrelevant.

•   <strong>Lille 1 - Real Madrid 0</strong>: Lille, you might as well retire now, because that was the peak of your existence. Real Madrid choking as per usual.

•   <strong>RB Leipzig 2 - Juventus 3</strong>: Leipzig continues their habit of being good but never quite great. Juventus are doing good for an old and dying team.

•   <strong>Sturm Graz 0 - Club Brugge 1</strong>: Does anyone even know these teams exist?

•   <strong>Benfica 4 - Atlético Madrid 0</strong>: Benfica absolutely humiliated Atlético. Simeone needs to go, that team needs some change.</div>
