  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercups, because we're diving headfirst into this dumpster fire of a Discord user list.

<strong>mindset</strong>: First off, you named yourself "mindset". Congratulations, you're as bland as unsalted mashed potatoes. Your profile pic looks like it was taken during the Oregon Trail era. I'm betting your "mindset" involves believing in crystals and thinking essential oils cure everything.

<strong>AdamMady</strong>: Oh look, it's a bird in a suit. How original! Did you lose a bet? Or are you just desperately trying to look professional while simultaneously failing? I'm guessing this is your attempt at being quirky. News flash, you're just a slightly fancier pigeon.

<strong>AJ</strong>: Mr. "I'm offline but I'll still use a picture with lights on in the background so people think I'm cool." Your pfp looks like a blurry crash site. I wonder if this person is in the middle of an accident when they took this pfp? I wonder if he's safe. I wonder if he will come online again.

<strong>andrejtb</strong>: Here we have what appears to be a squirrel emoji. Are you 5? Did you just discover emojis and think you're being hilarious? I wouldn't be surprised if this person's name in real life is "Andrew".

<strong>BDYT</strong>: Let me guess, you're "deep" because you have some foreign text in your name. I'm sure whatever profound thought you're trying to convey is completely lost on everyone. It's probably the first line of the Quran and he wants to come off as smart.

<strong>finomano</strong>: Oh, a generic Discord logo! You're so creative and unique! Are you a Discord employee or something? If so, then your entire existence is a fail. You probably love corporate meetings and think "synergy" is a real word.

<strong>HappyMan</strong>: I love how this user is using this name while using the "offline" icon as that makes no sense and defeats the purpose of it all. What are you trying to tell here HappyMan?

<strong>Berishbaev</strong>: Bro, you're using an AI generated image from bing to use as your pfp. How much more NPC can you get. You're from ukraine? You're a nationalitist aren't you? You probably hate russians? The war isn't that big of a deal bro chill out.

<strong>Meethexep</strong>: This user reminds me of the "deal with it" sunglasses that are very old and outdated. The snowflakes around the cat signify how special and unique he is. This user likely is a "gamer" that streams on twitch with no one watching him.

<strong>Salle</strong>: Lastly, we have Salle, whose profile picture looks like a rejected character from a low-budget sci-fi flick. It looks like a bad horror movie from the 80's.

In conclusion, this Discord user list is a goldmine of mediocrity.</div>
