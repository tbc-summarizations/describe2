  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest, roast-filled take on these quarter-final matches:

•   <strong>Switzerland 0 - 2 Belgium:</strong> Switzerland, you're like that boring neutral friend everyone tolerates. You had your run, now go back to making watches and chocolate. Belgium, you finally showed some teeth! Now go win something for once.

•   <strong>Hungary 1 - 2 Portugal:</strong> Hungary, you put up a fight, but against Ronaldo? Come on, it was always going to be a dramatic loss. Portugal, you barely squeaked by. At least Ronaldo is still kicking it!

•   <strong>Italy 0 - 1 Netherlands:</strong> Italy, where's your legendary defense? Oh wait, the Dutch taught you how to play the catenaccio! The Netherlands, you did it! You actually managed to score and defend at the same time! Now go win something to compensate for the lack of winning.

•   <strong>France 0 - 2 Spain:</strong> France, from World Cup champions to getting shut out by Spain? What happened to the Mbappe hype? Spain, finally, a team that remembered how to score goals. Don't get ahead of yourselves though, you have a history of choking in the semi-finals.</div>
