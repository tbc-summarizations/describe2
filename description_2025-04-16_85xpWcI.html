  <h1>Description for BattleForNiggas3.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this Stop Breathing character from the object show.

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Stop Breathing is a contestant in this competition whose existence is based off of the youtube video called "what if the beatles never existed". It is unknown if Stop Breathing is the character that created the video or someone that just enjoys this video.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Visually, Stop Breathing is composed of two main elements which are the thumbnail for the "What if the beatles never existed" youtube video and a comment under this video. He has two stick figure legs that look goofy.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Stop Breathing seems extremely violent. Under a comment that questions what song is it, Stop Breathing just replies to stop breathing to the person that asked the question, implying that if the person keeps asking questions they will die.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

As seen in the video, Stop Breathing can use AK-47s to hurt his enemies and can also use a nuclear weapon. It seems he is a weapon creator because he forces his victims to press the "nuclear weapon creator" button.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Stop Breathing seems like an extremely vile character with violent tendancies. He doesn't seem to have any morals and is willing to use weapons to hurt people. I would rate him a 0/10, horrible.</div>
