  <h1>Description for Rockwell_Retro_Encabulator.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">I've watched the video, and honestly, that guy is full of it! He's trying to sound smart, but he is really just trying to sell this "Retroencabulator" thing. I think it's a big joke, but he is trying to sell it to adults.

Here's the idea if I had to explain it to a 5-year-old:

He's like a magician trying to make electricity! He has all these fancy tools and gears from different companies that all work together. Instead of making electricity the normal way, by spinning magnets like a windmill, he uses something different which sounds like he is mixing magnets and glue.

I think it's weird! He's just trying to make something that sounds really cool so the adults will buy it. So really, it's just a bunch of fancy words to sell some electrical thing. I think it's a bunch of baloney!</div>
