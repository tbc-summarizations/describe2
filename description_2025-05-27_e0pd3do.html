  <h1>Description for 19662.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Okzhetpes squad with brutal honesty.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Oleksiy Shevchenko:</strong> Unknown quantity, playing in Kazakhstan doesn't inspire confidence. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Kazhymukan Tolepbergen:</strong> Kazakh league journeyman. Probably decent at best. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Danil Podymskiy:</strong> Backup material. Might get a game if things go south. <strong>2/10</strong>

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Franjo Prce:</strong> Croatian defender... likely decent but probably overpriced for what he brings. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Nurlan Dairov:</strong> Unremarkable Kazakh defender. Probably makes a lot of mistakes. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Niyaz Idrisov:</strong> Another Kazakh defender. Probably not much better than Dairov. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sanzhar Satanov:</strong> Sounds like a stage name. Probably plays like one too. <strong>1/10</strong>
•   <strong>Viktor Zyabko:</strong> Solid Kazakh defender. Has a good amount of experience. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sultan Abilgazy:</strong> Probably young. Most likely raw. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Timur Dosmagambetov:</strong> Veteran. Probably past his prime. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Enzo:</strong> Brazilian defender. Is a bit of a journeyman. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Beksultan Shamshi:</strong> Kazakh defender. Inexperienced and mistake-prone. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Viktor Gunchenko:</strong> Decent player, not much else to say. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Arsen Ashirbek:</strong> Decent player, not much else to say. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Salamat Zhumabekov:</strong> Probably just exists to fill a roster spot. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Nikola Cuckic:</strong> Serbian. Probably the creative force of this team. <strong>7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Adam Adakhadzhiev:</strong> Useless player, probably only in the team because of connections. <strong>0/10</strong>
•   <strong>Aslan Darabaev:</strong> Just there to make up numbers. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Kobylandy Kamariden:</strong> Has potential. Can improve the team in the future. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Strahinja Jovanovic:</strong> Serbian striker. Probably the main source of goals. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Aliyar Mukhammed:</strong> Local talent? Likely inconsistent. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Batyrkhan Tazhibay:</strong> Doubt he's scoring double digits. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Damir Marat:</strong> Probably injury-prone. <strong>1/10</strong>
•   <strong>Dauren Zhumat:</strong> Local Kazakh player, probably not very good. <strong>2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Shyngys Flyuk:</strong> No impact player whatsoever. <strong>1/10</strong>
•   <strong>Vladislav Prokopenko:</strong> Probably not good enough for this league. <strong>3/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

A mishmash of mediocrity, journeymen, and unproven youngsters. Cuckic and Jovanovic might provide some spark, but the defense looks shaky and the overall squad lacks any real star power. This is a relegation-battle squad, plain and simple.

<strong>Overall: 3/10</strong></div>
