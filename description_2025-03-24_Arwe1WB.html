  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I see these 2024-25 UEFA Nations League matches playing out, no holds barred:

<strong>Spain vs. Denmark:</strong> Spain's tiki-taka bullshit is gonna be suffocated by the Danes' physical play. Denmark's Eriksen will orchestrate a midfield masterclass, exposing Spain's aging legs. <strong>Prediction: Denmark wins 2-1.</strong>

<strong>Serbia vs. Switzerland:</strong> This is gonna be a bloodbath. Both teams have players with short fuses. Serbia's Vlahovic will get frustrated by Switzerland's organized defense and get sent off. Switzerland's Shaqiri, despite being past his prime, will score a late winner. <strong>Prediction: Switzerland wins 1-0.</strong>

<strong>Spain vs. Serbia:</strong> Spain's gonna be desperate for points after getting humiliated by Denmark. They'll try to dominate possession, but Serbia's Mitrovic is gonna bully their center-backs. Spain's gonna get a lucky penalty. <strong>Prediction: Spain wins 2-1 (barely).</strong>

<strong>Denmark vs. Switzerland:</strong> The Danes will underestimate the Swiss. Switzerland's gonna exploit Denmark's defensive vulnerabilities with quick counter-attacks. The Danes will choke under pressure in front of their home crowd. <strong>Prediction: Switzerland wins 2-1.</strong>

<strong>Serbia vs. Denmark:</strong> Another physical game. Serbia's gonna try to intimidate Denmark, but the Danes won't back down. The game will devolve into a tactical stalemate. A late goal from a set-piece will decide the game. <strong>Prediction: Serbia wins 1-0.</strong>

<strong>Switzerland vs. Spain:</strong> Spain's gonna be humbled and desperate. They'll park the bus and hope for a draw. Switzerland's gonna dominate possession but struggle to break down Spain's stubborn defense. It's gonna be a boring 0-0 draw. <strong>Prediction: 0-0 Draw.</strong>

<strong>Denmark vs. Spain:</strong> The Danes are gonna smell blood after Spain's lackluster performance against Switzerland. They'll come out firing on all cylinders, pressing high and forcing Spain into mistakes. Spain's gonna crumble under the pressure. <strong>Prediction: Denmark wins 3-1.</strong>

<strong>Switzerland vs. Serbia:</strong> This match will be dirty and full of fouls. Both teams hate each other. The match ends in a 1-1 draw with at least one player getting sent off. It is what it is. <strong>Prediction: 1-1 Draw.</strong>

<strong>Serbia vs. Spain:</strong> Serbia is going to be mad and play super aggressively, tackling everyone. The ref will struggle to control the game. Spain's soft players can't handle the Serbian onslaught and will lose again. <strong>Prediction: Serbia wins 2-0</strong>

<strong>Switzerland vs. Denmark:</strong> Switzerland will be full of confidence after their results. Denmark might be tired after pushing hard. Switzerland will dominate the field, especially with support from their fans. They should be able to get the 3 points. <strong>Prediction: Switzerland wins 2-1.</strong>

<strong>Denmark vs. Serbia:</strong> This game will be a bore, the match is inconsequential as both teams will not be making the nations league final, so they will not care. <strong>Prediction: 1-1 Draw.</strong>

<strong>Spain vs. Switzerland:</strong> Spain's pride will be on the line. They will want to try and avoid relegation from League A. Switzerland might rest players, but Spain should be able to win. <strong>Prediction: Spain wins 2-1.</strong>

In short, Spain is a joke and will struggle. Denmark and Switzerland will battle for the top spot, and Serbia will be the wildcard, capable of causing upsets.</div>
