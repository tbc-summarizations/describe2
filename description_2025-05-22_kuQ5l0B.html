  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">So, Leverkusen, a team famous for choking more than a pornstar at a bachelor party, manages to lose 2-0 to Atletico Madrid, despite having more shots, shots on target, passes, distance covered, and possession. It seems they forgot the one stat that actually matters: goals. Typical Leverkusen, masters of mediocrity, forever destined to be bridesmaids at the altar of European glory.

And Atletico, oh, Atletico. They win with two measly shots on target, playing like a team of hungover snails. They must have bribed the soccer gods or something, because there's no way they deserved that victory. Congrats on the win, you uninspired, lucky bastards. Now go back to parking the bus and praying for another fluke goal.</div>
