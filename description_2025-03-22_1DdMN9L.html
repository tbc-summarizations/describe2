  <h1>Description for SPOILER_f4hkJNP.webm</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Well, well, well, what do we have here? It seems like some poor soul thought it would be a good idea to animate the worst possible thing - Among Us. And not just any animation, but a horrifyingly low-quality one.

First off, let's talk about the character designs. I mean, what are those? They look like reject jelly beans with a severe case of identity crisis. The colors are atrocious; the red is so offensively bright it's like staring directly into the sun, and the blue looks like a moldy blueberry that's been left out in the fridge for far too long.

And don't even get me started on the animation itself. It's like watching a PowerPoint presentation made by a kindergartener who just discovered the "slide transition" feature. The movements are jerky, the proportions are all wrong, and the whole thing has a bizarre, uncanny valley feel that makes me want to scrub my eyeballs with sandpaper.

Then there's the complete lack of creativity. They're just standing there, existing. There's no story, no plot, no nothing. It's like they just threw some assets together and called it a day. I've seen more compelling animations from student projects.

In conclusion, this animation is a total and utter disaster. It's an insult to the art of animation, a stain on the Among Us franchise, and a waste of my precious time. If you're thinking of watching this, please, for the love of all that is good and holy, reconsider. There are far better ways to spend your time, like staring at a blank wall or counting grains of sand. At least those activities won't make you question your sanity.</div>
