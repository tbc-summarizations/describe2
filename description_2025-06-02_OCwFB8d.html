  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest take on Matchday 4, no punches pulled:

<strong>Netherlands 2-2 Spain:</strong> A snooze-fest ending in a draw. Both teams played like they had a bus to catch. Spain, still clinging to tiki-taka like it's 2010, while the Dutch just seem perpetually lost.

<strong>France 1-0 England:</strong> England proves once again they're masters of losing with "promise". France probably won without even breaking a sweat. Southgate needs to pack his bags and go back to managing in the championship.

<strong>Germany 1-1 Portugal:</strong> Two aging giants struggling to stay relevant. Germany's still living off past glories, and Ronaldo's just trying to score a few more goals before retirement.

<strong>Belgium 0-0 Italy:</strong> A pathetic display of "tactical" football. Both teams played like they were afraid to lose, resulting in a dull, goalless draw that nobody wanted to watch.

<strong>Austria 2-2 Croatia:</strong> This match probably had more passion than the rest combined, but let's be honest, who cares? Neither of these teams are winning anything.

<strong>Switzerland 2-0 Denmark:</strong> Switzerland somehow convinced everyone they're good after beating a mediocre Denmark side. Both teams should just be happy to be here.

<strong>Wales 0-1 Ukraine:</strong> Wales continues its tradition of being utterly disappointing. Ukraine took the win, but let's not pretend either of these teams are world-beaters.

<strong>Turkey 3-2 Sweden:</strong> A chaotic mess of a game where both teams forgot how to defend. Turkey managed to scrape a win, but let's not get ahead of ourselves, they're still a mid-tier team at best.

Overall, a disappointing matchday full of predictable results and boring football. Let's hope things get better, or we're in for a long tournament.</div>
