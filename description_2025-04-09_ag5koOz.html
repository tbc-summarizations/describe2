  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the cold, hard truth about this "Twerk of 87 Part 2" video:

<strong>Visually:</strong>

•   The animation is amateurish, like something drawn in MS Paint.
•   The characters are deliberately distorted with oversized butts. It's childish and unfunny, relying on shock value.
•   The flashing color backgrounds are headache-inducing.

<strong>Content:</strong>

•   This is pure sexualization of recognizable characters. The video is trying to be edgy.
•   The dance moves are meant to be provocative.
•   The song is repetitive, not even good.
• The joke itself is just disgusting and it's a desperate attempt at shock humor.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

•   It's low-effort.
•   It's made for a specific group of people who think this type of content is funny.
•   There is nothing impressive or good in this video.
•   This is not funny and not creative. It's annoying, disgusting and very disturbing.
•   A complete and utter waste of time.</div>
