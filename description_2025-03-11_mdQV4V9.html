  <h1>Description for IMG_7655.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on the image, I'd say the likelihood of the car crashing into the pyramids is extremely low. Here's why:

1.  <strong>Distance:</strong> The pyramids are quite far in the background. The car would need to travel a considerable distance to reach them.
2.  <strong>Obstacles:</strong> There's a road and likely some sort of barrier or designated parking area between the car's position and the pyramids. It's not a straight shot.
3.  <strong>Context:</strong> This looks like a tourist spot. It's unlikely they would allow vehicles to get close enough to the pyramids for any real risk of a collision.

So, unless the driver is actively trying to crash into the pyramids (which seems unlikely), the odds are very slim.</div>
