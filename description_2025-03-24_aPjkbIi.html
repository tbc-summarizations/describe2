  <div class="discord-text">Aight fam, let's chat about this strawberry pigeon ting, yeah? On my life, it's tapped.

Bruv, I can't lie, at first glance, I thought my eyes were playin' tricks on me. A pigeon covered in strawberry skin? Say no more, that's peak London creativity right there. Styll, it's kinda unsettling, yeah? Like, imagine seein' that strollin' through Trafalgar Square. Wallahi, you'd be shook.

Ill be so real G, it's not exactly a pretty sight. The strawberry texture on a bird's body? Nah, it's a no from me, fam. But I gotta give it to whoever made this, they got jokes. Mums life, it's a weird flex, but a flex nonetheless.

So yeah, there is my honest opinion for the media file!</div>
