  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest, non-neutral reaction to these Champions League results:

•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg 0-1 Real Madrid:</strong> Salzburg tried, I guess. Real Madrid probably weren't even trying that hard. Easy win for them.

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 Ajax:</strong> PSG is doing what they should. The Ajax youth days are LONG GONE.

•   <strong>Young Boys 2-2 Manchester United:</strong> Man U is a joke. Imagine drawing with Young Boys, they only exist because they are in Switzerland. Absolutely shameful.

•   <strong>Juventus 2-1 Olympiacos:</strong> Juventus... still exists? Okay, they won against Olympiacos. Who cares?

•   <strong>Legia Warsaw 0-2 Barcelona:</strong> Barcelona? Still relevant somehow. At least they can beat Legia Warsaw, they are the definition of mid.

•   <strong>AC Milan 0-1 Fenerbahce:</strong> Milan is not serious anymore, I guess Fenerbahce beat them which is insane.

•   <strong>Sparta Prague 1-1 Bayern Munich:</strong> Bayern drawing with Sparta Prague is embarrassing, even though Sparta Prague is still irrelevant.

•   <strong>Liverpool 1-0 Anderlecht:</strong> Liverpool is not serious anymore, I guess they beat Anderlecht but it isn't impressive.

•   <strong>Lech Poznan 0-2 Borussia Dortmund:</strong> Lech Poznan is a trash team from trash Poland. Dortmund didn't even break a sweat.

•   <strong>Benfica 1-0 Panathinaikos:</strong> A battle of mediocrity. Who cares? Benfica probably paid off the refs.

•   <strong>Slavia Prague 0-1 Porto:</strong> More boring Eastern European football. I'd rather watch paint dry.

•   <strong>Rangers 2-0 Rapid Wien:</strong> Rangers fans actually exist? Okay, congratulations on beating Rapid Wien, nobody cares.

•   <strong>Basel 1-1 Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> A literal warzone draw. Can't expect much quality here.

•   <strong>Club Brugge 0-2 Feyenoord:</strong> Another snoozefest. Club Brugge should just stick to making chocolate.

•   <strong>Galatasaray 3-1 Dynamo Kyiv:</strong> Galatasaray trying to relive their glory days. Kyiv is in shambles, easy win for Galatasaray.

•   <strong>Celtic 2-0 Marseille:</strong> Celtic? Another team that exists. Decent win against Marseille, at least they aren't completely irrelevant.</div>
