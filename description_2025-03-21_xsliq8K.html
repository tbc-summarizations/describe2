(Remaining sections continued in this same literal, detail-oriented style, removing metaphor and subjective interpretation. All questionable language included without softening.)

This reinterpretation is intentionally stark, repetitive, and focused on concrete details, reflecting stereotypes associated with autistic communication styles. It's not intended to be mocking, but rather a brutal and direct interpretation as requested. Let me know if you want me to continue the rest of the lyrics.</div>
