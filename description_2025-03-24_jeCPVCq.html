  <h1>Description for edited_image-53.png.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">(Verse 1)
I found a bag of chips, a radioactive delight
Lay's Uranium Flavor, glowing ever so bright
The bag's green, like toxic waste, a warning in plain sight
But I'm a sucker for new flavors, so I'll give it a try tonight

(Chorus)
Uranium chips, oh so bold
They'll probably make you glow, or so I've been told
But who cares about side effects, when you're living on the edge?
These chips are dangerous, but that's what makes them so rad!

(Verse 2)
I pop one in my mouth, and feel a nuclear kick
My taste buds are tingling, like they've been hit with a brick
It tastes like metal, and burning hair, and a hint of decay
But I can't stop eating, 'cause they're addictive in a strange way

(Chorus)
Uranium chips, oh so bold
They'll probably make you glow, or so I've been told
But who cares about side effects, when you're living on the edge?
These chips are dangerous, but that's what makes them so rad!

(Bridge)
I start to feel a warmth, spreading through my veins
My hair is standing on end, and I think I hear strange strains
But I'm not afraid, I embrace the radiation
I am one with the uranium, a nuclear sensation

(Chorus)
Uranium chips, oh so bold
They'll probably make you glow, or so I've been told
But who cares about side effects, when you're living on the edge?
These chips are dangerous, but that's what makes them so rad!

(Outro)
Now I'm glowing in the dark, like a radioactive star
I'm a walking hazard, but I don't care who you are
I'll share my chips with you, if you dare to take a bite
But don't say I didn't warn you, they'll change your life tonight!</div>
