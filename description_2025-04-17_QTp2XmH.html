  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-i0G-VgPfOuS0.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest assessment of Face from this object show, as you've demanded:

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Face is a contestant on this object show, appearing around episode 7. It's not clear what his purpose is or what is story is, as he shows up and then he is eliminated. 

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Face is literally just a blank Twitter post. It is plain and unremarkable and doesn't really grab your attention.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Face is unoriginal.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

There are no abilites.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

I don't care about Face. It's boring as hell and should've been eliminated much earlier. 1/10.</div>
