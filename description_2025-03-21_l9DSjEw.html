  <h1>Description for 800px-Hitler_portrait_crop.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because we're about to dissect this historical fashion disaster and everything else that's wrong with this picture.

First off, let's talk about the elephant in the room, or rather, the toothbrush on his face. That mustache? It's like a caterpillar took a wrong turn and died under his nose. It's so comically small, it looks like he's trying to hide a crumb from his lunch. Did no one ever tell him he looked ridiculous? 

And the hair? It looks like a badly maintained lawn. I bet it feels like straw to the touch.

Now, let's move on to the outfit. That suit looks like it was designed by someone who never learned to measure. It's so stiff and boxy, it looks like he's wearing cardboard. The buttons look like warts.

And what's with all the medals? Is he compensating for something? He looks like a Christmas tree ornament gone wrong.

That armband, well... We all know what that represents, and it's about as tasteful as a clown at a funeral. It is there to cause as much suffering as possible to as many people as possible.

And that expression? He looks like he just realized he left the oven on.

Honestly, this picture is a treasure trove of awful. It's like a museum of bad decisions, both sartorial and, well, you know, everything else. This picture serves as a reminder of what happens when you let one person control fashion choices and the world's direction.</div>
