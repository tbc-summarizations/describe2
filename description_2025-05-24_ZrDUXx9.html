  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on that XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Marc-Andre Ter Stegen:</strong> 8/10. A genuinely world-class keeper when he's on form, but prone to the odd inexplicable blunder.
•   <strong>Norbert Gyomber:</strong> 5/10. A solid, but not exceptional, defender. Will get the job done but nothing more.
•   <strong>Joshua Kimmich:</strong> 7/10. Hugely versatile, but better in midfield. At fullback his defensive weaknesses are more exposed.
•   <strong>David Raum:</strong> 6/10. Decent going forward, questionable defensively. A modern fullback who prioritizes attacking.
•   <strong>Lubomir Satka:</strong> 5/10. Similar to Gyomber, nothing particularly special. Just a guy at the back.
•   <strong>Florian Wirtz:</strong> 9/10. Immense talent, a real difference-maker with incredible vision and creativity.
•   <strong>Leon Goretzka:</strong> 6/10. Can be a powerhouse, but inconsistent. Prone to disappearing in big games.
•   <strong>Leroy Sane:</strong> 7/10. Explosive winger, but frustratingly inconsistent. Too often makes the wrong decision.
•   <strong>Jamal Musiala:</strong> 8/10. Electric dribbler with incredible potential, needs to improve his end product.
•   <strong>Serge Gnabry:</strong> 6/10. Decent goalscorer, but lacks the quality to be a consistent game-changer at the highest level.
•   <strong>Niclas Fullkrug:</strong> 5/10. A decent target man. Nothing special, but can get a goal.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

Overall: <strong>6/10</strong>.

This team has some serious talent in midfield and in goal. However, the defense is shaky and the attack lacks a truly world-class focal point. The midfield needs to carry the team and hope the defense holds on. This team has a few nice pieces but its a poorly constructed team. Ultimately this team looks pretty terrible.</div>
