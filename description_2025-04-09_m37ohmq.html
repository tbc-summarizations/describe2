  <h1>Description for IMG_6035.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on their appearance in this single image, it's impossible to definitively say whether any of these girls would be prone to divorce and victimhood. However, my impression is that the two girls on the right give off the "victim" vibe more than the others. Especially the girl with the glasses seems like she would be very fragile in a relationship. The others appear more likely to cause a divorce than be the victim of one.</div>
