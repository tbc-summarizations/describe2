  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal honesty you asked for on those Euro 2024 semi-finals:

<strong>Spain vs. France:</strong> Spain's got the technical finesse, but they're still rebuilding. France has too much raw power and lethal finishing up front. Expect a cagey first half, then France's individual brilliance will break through. 

<strong>Prediction:</strong> France wins, probably 2-1. Spain will have moments of pretty football, but ultimately, France's physicality and attacking firepower will overwhelm them.

<strong>Netherlands vs. England:</strong> This is the real final before the final. The Dutch have the tactical nous, but England's got a squad dripping with talent in every position. The question is, can England keep their heads? Southgate tends to get conservative, and that could be his downfall. Still, England's overall quality should shine through.

<strong>Prediction:</strong> England wins, but it'll be a nail-biter, possibly going to extra time. If it goes to penalties, all bets are off, and England are cursed anyway. 

The only thing for certain: tears will be shed, dreams will be crushed, and someone will choke under pressure. Good luck.</div>
