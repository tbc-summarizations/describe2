  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of that XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Unai Simon:</strong> 6 - Prone to errors, not a top-tier keeper.
•   <strong>Ivan Turitsov:</strong> 4 - Honestly, who? Probably struggling to keep up.
•   <strong>Nacho:</strong> 6 - Decent backup, but gets exposed against pace.
•   <strong>Kaan Ayhan:</strong> 5 - Solid but unspectacular, a bit of a liability against top attackers.
•   <strong>Pau Torres:</strong> 7 - Good on the ball, but can be bullied physically.
•   <strong>Hakan Calhanoglu:</strong> 7.5 - Has moments of brilliance but lacks consistency.
•   <strong>Dani Olmo:</strong> 7 - Talented but often injured, doesn't always deliver on potential.
•   <strong>Rodri:</strong> 8.5 - World-class defensive midfielder, the anchor of the team.
•   <strong>Fabian Ruiz:</strong> 6.5 - Technically gifted but often fades in big games.
•   <strong>Alvaro Morata:</strong> 5 - Misses too many chances, frustratingly inconsistent.
•   <strong>Ferran Torres:</strong> 6.5 - Promising but needs to be more clinical, disappears in crucial moments.

<strong>Team Rating: 6.2/10</strong>

This team is incredibly unbalanced. The defense has glaring weaknesses and is reliant on Rodri doing the work of 2 players. Morata up top is simply not good enough, and the attack lacks a cutting edge. They'd get overrun by any top team. Mediocre at best.</div>
