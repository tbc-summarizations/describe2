  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's rip into Armenia for this pathetic showing. Getting thrashed 6-1? That's not a soccer match, that's a public execution on the field. The fact that their <em>only</em> goal was a pity goal in the 48th minute just adds insult to injury. They were so bad, even Georgia felt generous enough to let them score.

And look at that ball possession stat – a measly 36%? They spent more time watching Georgia play than actually playing themselves. I bet their team bus had more action than they did in Georgia's penalty box. Seriously, Armenia, you call that a performance? You should be ashamed to even show your faces in the locker room. Maybe stick to chess – at least the pieces don't move <em>that</em> fast.</div>
