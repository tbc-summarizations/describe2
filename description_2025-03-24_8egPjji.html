  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest breakdown of the Euro 2024 Group F:

•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> They'll put up a fight early but collapse under pressure. They'll have flashes of brilliance but lack the consistency and mental fortitude to make it out of the group stage. Their fans will be loud but ultimately disappointed.

•   <strong>Georgia:</strong> This is their first major tournament and it will show. They'll be a tough out, full of heart and passion, but outmatched in terms of talent and experience. They might steal a point but will likely be the whipping boys of the group.

•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> Cristiano Ronaldo will be playing with a point to prove, even if he's a shadow of his former self. They'll dominate possession and score goals. They'll be favorites to win the group.

•   <strong>Czechia:</strong> They're consistent but rarely spectacular. They'll grind out results, be defensively solid, and rely on moments of individual brilliance. They'll be a pain to play against and will likely secure second place in the group.

<strong>Prediction:</strong>

1.  Portugal
2.  Czechia
3.  Turkey
4.  Georgia</div>
