  <h1>Description for 800px-West_Ham_United_FC_logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's rip this squad apart, brutally honest style:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Graham Potter:</strong> 5/10. Overrated. Had one good spell at Brighton, but his time at Chelsea proved he's tactically inflexible and struggles with big personalities. Don't expect wonders.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Lukasz Fabianski:</strong> 6/10. He's past his prime. Reliable on his day, but prone to errors and doesn't command the box enough.
•   <strong>Alphonse Areola:</strong> 6.5/10. Slightly better than Fabianski but nothing special at all. He's another decent backup option.
•   <strong>Wesley Foderingham:</strong> 4/10. Average at best. Should not be anywhere near this squad.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Vladimir Coufal:</strong> 6/10. Decent work rate, but limited technically. Gets caught out defensively far too often.
•   <strong>Aaron Wan-Bissaka:</strong> 5/10. One-dimensional defender, offers nothing going forward.
•   <strong>Aaron Cresswell:</strong> 5/10. Slow, aging, and often exposed.
•   <strong>Konstantinos Mavropanos:</strong> 5/10. Too inconsistent.
•   <strong>Max Kilman:</strong> 7/10. Solid defender, good in the air, but needs a stronger partner.
•   <strong>Jean-Clair Todibo:</strong> 7.5/10. Good potential and very solid defender.
•   <strong>Kaelan Casey:</strong> 3/10. Not ready for the Premier League.
•   <strong>Emerson:</strong> 6.5/10. Reliable and consistent, good on the ball.
•   <strong>Oliver Scarles:</strong> 3/10. Probably won't ever be ready for the Premier League.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>James Ward-Prowse:</strong> 7.5/10. Set-piece specialist, great delivery, but lacks pace.
•   <strong>Tomas Soucek:</strong> 6/10. Aerially dominant, but clumsy on the ball and often out of position.
•   <strong>Guido Rodriguez:</strong> 6.5/10. Solid defensive midfielder.
•   <strong>Edson Alvarez:</strong> 7/10. Good workrate, solid defensively.
•   <strong>Andy Irving:</strong> 4/10. Not Premier League level.
•   <strong>Lewis Orford:</strong> 3/10.
•   <strong>Carlos Soler:</strong> 6.5/10. Reliable.
•   <strong>Lucas Paqueta:</strong> 8/10. Creative, skillful, and a potential match-winner, but needs to stay focused.
•   <strong>Mohammed Kudus:</strong> 8/10. Skillful and very direct winger.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Jarrod Bowen:</strong> 8.5/10. Consistently scores goals, works tirelessly, but needs more support.
•   <strong>Crysencio Summerville:</strong> 7.5/10. Very promising.
•   <strong>Luis Guilherme:</strong> 7/10. Decent young attacker.
•   <strong>Michail Antonio:</strong> 6/10. Past his best, injuries holding him back.
•   <strong>Danny Ings:</strong> 5/10. A shadow of his former self.
•   <strong>Niclas Füllkrug:</strong> 6/10. Average target man, not clinical enough.
•   <strong>Evan Ferguson:</strong> 8/10. A lot of potential in him.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 6.2/10</strong>

This squad has a few bright spots, but it's riddled with mediocrity and aging players. Potter won't do well in this system. The defense is shaky, the midfield lacks creativity, and the attack is too reliant on a few individuals. West Ham fans should be preparing for a season of mid-table mediocrity, at best.</div>
