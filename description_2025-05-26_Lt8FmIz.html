  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest roast of Matchday 7 results:

•   <strong>Monaco vs Aston Villa:</strong> Monaco barely scraped by, beating Villa. Congratulations on defeating a team that's likely struggling to figure out what continent they're even on.
•   <strong>Atalanta vs Sturm Graz:</strong> Atalanta finally found a team they could actually score against. I bet Sturm Graz is just happy to get a free trip to Italy to get battered.
•   <strong>Atlético Madrid vs Bayer Leverkusen:</strong> Atlético doing what they do best – a boring 2-1 win. Leverkusen probably spent more time complaining than playing.
•   <strong>Bologna vs Borussia Dortmund:</strong> Dortmund, still choking away from home, huh? Bologna celebrated like they won the Champions League, meanwhile, Dortmund's fans are wondering where their title challenge went.
•   <strong>Club Brugge vs Juventus:</strong> A 0-0 draw? In a Champions League match? These teams are equally boring. The highlight of the game was probably the snack bar.
•   <strong>Red Star Belgrade vs PSV Eindhoven:</strong> Red Star almost pulled off something decent, only to collapse like the cheap Belgrade buildings they probably practice next to.
•   <strong>Liverpool vs Lille:</strong> Liverpool, just barely doing enough to justify their overpriced squad. Lille showed up to visit the Anfield crowd and that's all they had to offer.
•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava vs VfB Stuttgart:</strong> Slovan Bratislava, just happy to be there. Stuttgart finally remembered they're a football team, not a fashion brand.
•   <strong>Benfica vs Barcelona:</strong> A 4-5 goalfest? Someone forgot to tell the defenses they were supposed to defend. Congrats to Barca for winning what probably feels like a friendly.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk vs Brest:</strong> Shakhtar, playing like they have something to prove. Brest looked as lost as they did on the map finding Eastern Europe.
•   <strong>RB Leipzig vs Sporting CP:</strong> Leipzig pulled out a win, but they're still unlikable. Sporting, better luck next time, but not really.
•   <strong>Milan vs Girona:</strong> Milan, just edging out another win. How dull. Girona, you came, you saw, you went home.
•   <strong>Sparta Prague vs Inter Milan:</strong> Inter barely squeaking by. Sparta, back to irrelevance.
•   <strong>Arsenal vs Dinamo Zagreb:</strong> Arsenal, actually performing like they should. Dinamo Zagreb got a free trip to London and a harsh reminder of their place in the football world.
•   <strong>Celtic vs Young Boys:</strong> Celtic eking out a narrow win. Young Boys should stick to Switzerland.
•   <strong>Feyenoord vs Bayern Munich:</strong> This is a surprising result! Bayern Munich getting absolutely humiliated. Time for the Bayern bosses to start panicking.
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain vs Manchester City:</strong> PSG spending all that money and barely winning. City getting exposed for being overrated.
•   <strong>Real Madrid vs Red Bull Salzburg:</strong> Real Madrid, reminding everyone why they're the kings. Salzburg, learning a painful lesson in the difference between energy drinks and actual talent.</div>
