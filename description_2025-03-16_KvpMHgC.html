  <h1>Description for IMG_3095.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because we're about to tear this saccharine sweet image apart!

First of all, "Why do we have hands?" is the dumbest philosophical question I've seen all week, and I just watched a cat try to fight its reflection for 20 minutes. It's like asking why we have feet, as if evolution just threw things at us randomly. 

And those floating gloves! They look like they escaped from a Mickey Mouse cartoon that got infected with a bizarre fetish. What's with the weird black beads on the wrist? Are they trying to be edgy or something? They look like chewed-up bubblegum.

Now, let's talk about "Liy," whoever or whatever that is. This smug, blushing rectangle with a door on its face seems to think it's the center of the universe. I bet it's got a "Live, Laugh, Liy" poster hanging up in its pathetic little cubicle of a home.

"Pat the Liy"? More like slap the Liy. That self-satisfied smirk is begging for a reality check. I bet Liy thinks it's all that and a bag of chips, but it's probably just a stale cracker in a sad, forgotten lunchbox.

"Hold the Liy"? Are you serious? It's a goddamn rectangle! I wouldn't hold that thing with a ten-foot pole, let alone with my precious, hand-shaped hands. It looks like it would give you splinters.

"Cherish the Liy"? Oh, please. I wouldn't cherish a pile of garbage this much. It probably smells like old textbooks and disappointment. And who cherishes things with their finger? It looks like it is a toddler petting a cat for the first time.

And finally, "Forfeit all mortal possessions to Liy"? Oh, for the love of all that is holy, no! Not even if you paid me! Look at that ridiculous outfit it's wearing! A cheap-ass pink dress and a dollar-store crown? It looks like a toddler who got into their mother's clothes and raided the costume closet.

The worst part is the little hearts and sparkles around the Liy. It's like they're trying to distract you from the fact that this whole image is a monument to mediocrity. This image is an insult to hands, to philosophy, and to anyone with a shred of self-respect. Burn it. Burn it all to the ground.</div>
