  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down Enrike21 from this object show.

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Enrike21 is a contestant. Not much is revealed about his backstory or origin. I don’t know where from or what his goal in the competition is, but he was only in one scene in the video.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Enrike21 presents as a Roblox avatar, specifically a worker wearing a green vest and a red cap with the letter "R." His limbs are stiff, as expected from a Roblox character, and his face bears the default, perpetually smiling expression. 

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Enrike21 exhibits zero personality. He lacks the character development, lines or any form of expression that would give him depth.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

Enrike21 has no known abilities. He is only an object shown.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Enrike21 is quite possibly the most boring character ever conceived. His lack of features and personality makes him a forgettable contestant. I can’t help but wonder if the show creators just threw him in there to fill a spot. Overall rating: 1/10. The one point is simply for existing.</div>
