  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's how these matches are going down, no holds barred:

<strong>3W 0L Bracket (Winner advances)</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> This is where things get ugly for England. The Dutch, with their tactical flexibility and ruthless efficiency, will expose England's defensive frailties. Southgate's overly cautious approach will be their downfall. Netherlands wins 3-1, with England's sole goal a consolation penalty.

•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 vs. Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong> Switzerland's disciplined defending will frustrate Belgium, but their lack of attacking firepower will be their undoing. Belgium's individual brilliance will shine through. Belgium wins 2-0, with Lukaku bullying the Swiss defense.

<strong>0W 3L Bracket (Loser Eliminated)</strong>

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱 vs. Slovakia 🇸🇰:</strong> A battle of mediocrity. Poland's Lewandowski will be visibly frustrated with the lack of service, but he'll still manage to nick a goal. Slovakia's attack is toothless. Poland wins 1-0 in a drab affair.

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 vs. Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Serbia's aggressive midfield and attacking threat will be too much for Ukraine to handle. Ukraine's defense will crumble under pressure. Serbia wins 4-1, leaving Ukraine's tournament hopes in tatters.</div>
