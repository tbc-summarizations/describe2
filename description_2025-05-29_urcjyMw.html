  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal, honest assessment you asked for, no sugarcoating:

<strong>Qualifiers:</strong>

•   <strong>Chelsea 2-0 Servette:</strong> A decent, professional job at home. 6/10. Nothing spectacular, just did what they needed to do.
•   <strong>Servette 2-1 Chelsea:</strong> Pathetic. Almost bottled it against a team they should have easily swept aside. 3/10. Inexcusable sloppiness.

<strong>League Phase:</strong>

•   <strong>Chelsea 4-2 Gent:</strong> Entertaining, but conceding two goals at home against Gent? Not good enough. 6/10.
•   <strong>Panathinaikos 1-4 Chelsea:</strong> A solid away win, but let's be honest, Panathinaikos isn't exactly a European powerhouse. 7/10.
•   <strong>Chelsea 8-0 Noah:</strong> Padding the stats against a minnow. Means absolutely nothing. 2/10 for the joke of an opponent.
•   <strong>Heidenheim 0-2 Chelsea:</strong> Another professional, but uninspiring, performance. 6/10.
•   <strong>Astana 1-3 Chelsea:</strong> Should be winning by more against a team from Kazakhstan. 5/10.
•   <strong>Chelsea 5-1 Shamrock Rovers:</strong> See Noah match. Stats padding. 2/10.

<strong>Round of 16:</strong>

•   <strong>Copenhagen 1-2 Chelsea:</strong> Good away win, but still allowed Copenhagen to score at home. 7/10.
•   <strong>Chelsea 1-0 Copenhagen:</strong> Barely scraped by at home against Copenhagen. Unacceptable. 4/10.

<strong>Quarter-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Legia Warsaw 0-3 Chelsea:</strong> Dominated a team they were expected to dominate. 7/10.
•   <strong>Chelsea 1-2 Legia Warsaw:</strong> Lost at home to Legia Warsaw? That's embarrassing. 2/10.

<strong>Semi-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Djurgardens 1-4 Chelsea:</strong> Finally showed some ruthlessness away from home. 8/10.
•   <strong>Chelsea 1-0 Djurgardens:</strong> Another uninspired performance at home. 5/10.

<strong>Final:</strong>

•   <strong>Real Betis 1-4 Chelsea:</strong> Okay, they finally showed up when it mattered. A dominant win in the final is the only thing saving this campaign. 9/10.

<strong>Overall Performance: 6/10</strong>

Chelsea won, but their road to victory was far from impressive. They struggled against mediocre teams, often looked uninspired, and had a couple of downright embarrassing performances. The only thing that saves them is winning the final convincingly. If they want to be taken seriously in Europe again, they need to improve drastically. This Conference League win is a bare minimum, not a sign of true progress.</div>
