  <h1>Description for 10157.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this Aktobe squad with the brutal honesty you requested.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Andrei Vlad (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´):</strong> Unknown entity outside of Romania. Likely average at best. <strong>4/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Igor Trofimets (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Probably a backup for a reason. Unlikely to be a game-changer. <strong>3/10</strong>

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Alibek Kasym (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Local player, likely solid but unspectacular. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Gaby Kiki (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡²):</strong> Foreign defender from Cameroon. Hard to gauge without seeing him play. Let's be generous and give him a <strong>6/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Nemanja Andjelkovic (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸):</strong> Another Eastern European. Probably a bit more experienced and potentially a leader. <strong>6.5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Sayat Zhumagali (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Again, likely a decent local player, but nothing special. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Bogdan VÄƒtÄƒjelu (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´):</strong> Romanian defender. Could be alright. <strong>6/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Adilkhan Tanzharikov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Another local defender. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Bagdat Kairov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Same as above. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Lev Skvortsov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Youth player? Probably not ready for significant playing time. <strong>4/10</strong>

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Uche Agbo (ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¬):</strong> Defensive midfielder. Could be a decent enforcer. <strong>6/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Mario Rabiu (ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¬):</strong> Another Nigerian midfielder. Maybe some potential, but likely average. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Ayan Baydavletov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Local midfielder. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Darkhan Berdibek (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Probably a squad player. <strong>4.5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Alisher Kenzhegulov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Seems like another local player. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Daniyar Usenov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Probably not much better than the rest of the local midfielders. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Jairo Jean (ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡¹):</strong> Haitian striker. Could be a wildcard. Let's say a <strong>6/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Freddy GÃ³ndola (ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¦):</strong> Panamanian. Again, another potentially unpredictable player. <strong>6/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Erkebulan Seydakhmet (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Young local striker. Might have some potential. <strong>5.5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Amadou Doumbouya (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡³):</strong> Guinean forward. Could be decent, but likely inconsistent. <strong>6/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Djordje Ivkovic (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸):</strong> Serbian forward. Might have some experience. <strong>6.5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Idris Umaev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Russian. Has a chance to become great player. <strong>7/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Oralkhan Omirtaev (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Local player. <strong>5/10</strong>
â€¢   <strong>Aybar Abdulla (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Same as above. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

Based on this analysis, it's a squad of mostly average players, with a few potentially decent foreigners and local players thrown in.

â€¢   <strong>Squad Rating: 5/10</strong>

This squad is likely to be mid-table at best, and could struggle to compete for the top spots. They lack genuine quality and star power. Brutally honest, as you requested.</div>
