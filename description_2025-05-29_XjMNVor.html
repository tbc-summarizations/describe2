  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of Tottenham's Europa League run, game by game and overall:

<strong>League Phase:</strong>

•   <strong>Tottenham 3-0 Qarabag:</strong> Against a weak side. A win, as expected. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ferencváros 1-2 Tottenham:</strong> Should be doing better against a Hungarian team that's not even their rivals. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Tottenham 1-0 AZ Alkmaar:</strong> Home game. It should be more than 1-0. Disappointing. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Galatasaray 3-2 Tottenham:</strong> Losing to Galatasaray after going to their place, embarrassing. <strong>Rating: 2/10</strong>
•   <strong>Tottenham 2-2 Roma:</strong> Drawing at home against Roma, nothing to be proud of. <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Rangers 1-1 Tottenham:</strong> Drawing Rangers away in Scotland. Barely acceptable. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>
•   <strong>TSG Hoffenheim 2-3 Tottenham:</strong> Scoring 3 away is good, but Hoffenheim is not a top team. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Tottenham 3-0 IF Elfsborg:</strong> Another weak team. Should win. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>

<strong>Round of 16:</strong>

•   <strong>AZ Alkmaar 1-0 Tottenham:</strong> Losing to AZ away, pathetic. <strong>Rating: 1/10</strong>
•   <strong>Tottenham 3-1 AZ Alkmaar:</strong> Only 3-1 at home to AZ? Lucky they made it through. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>

<strong>Quarter-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Tottenham 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt:</strong> Eintracht Frankfurt, at home, drawing 1-1? Bad performance. <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Eintracht Frankfurt 0-1 Tottenham:</strong> Getting a 1-0 win in Germany, good, but not enough to brag about. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>

<strong>Semi-Finals:</strong>

•   <strong>Tottenham 3-1 Bodø/Glimt:</strong> Bodø/Glimt at home? Should be winning by more. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Bodø/Glimt 0-2 Tottenham:</strong> 2-0 Away against a team like that is not impressive. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>

<strong>Final:</strong>

•   <strong>Tottenham 1-0 Manchester United:</strong> Beating Man United in a final is good. But only 1-0? Lucky result. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Rating: 5/10</strong>

Spurs got lucky a few times in this run. They beat teams they should have, but they also had several weak performances against lower-level opposition. Winning the final against a struggling Manchester United doesn't make up for the mediocrity of the rest of the tournament. It was a scrappy win, not a dominant one, and their road to the title was paved with more luck than skill.</div>
