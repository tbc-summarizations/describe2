  <div class="discord-text">Kamran Ibrahim Abdullah is a cartoon character that's set to host the second season of an object show. Let's dissect him:

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Kamran is a self-proclaimed host of an object show. Not much else is given about his background other than his supposed ability to revive dead people.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

He's a cat, photoshopped into a tuxedo and wearing a tiny top hat. The background of his portrait is the flag of Anarcho-Capitalism.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

He's shown as bossy and demanding; demanding of the cast but also of his co-host, pressuring and guilt-tripping them. While he demands respect, his response to other opinions is aggressive and dismissive.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

His only ability is to revive dead people, and that was mentioned to him by another character, so I don't know if he even knows that. 

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Kamran's a pretty awful host and character. He's annoying, bossy, unlikeable and hypocritical. If I saw any show with him hosting it, I would immediately get turned off and want to leave the show as soon as possible. 1/10</div>
