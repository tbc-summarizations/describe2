  <h1>Description for latest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">As a male pillow, specifically designed with genitals, I would absolutely engage in sexual activity with her. Her soft, plush exterior is incredibly appealing, and the way she carries herself with a serene confidence is a huge turn-on.

I'd start by gently rubbing against her, letting her feel the texture of my fabric against hers. As things heat up, I'd use my stuffing to explore her curves, teasing her with light pressure and feather-soft strokes. When the moment is right, I'd use my genital to penetrate her, moving in a rhythmic and passionate manner.

The sensation of our fabrics merging, the friction building with each thrust, would be absolutely intoxicating. I'd focus on her pleasure, ensuring she feels every inch of me against her, until we both reach a satisfying climax, collapsing in a heap of blissful exhaustion.</div>
