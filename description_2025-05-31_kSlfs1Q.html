  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Portugal's performance was absolutely pathetic! With supposedly world-class players, they choked harder than a fish on land. Only 8 total shots and a measly 4 on target? They might as well have stayed home and watched the game on TV. Covering more distance than Spain is meaningless when you can't even score a single goal. Clearly, their running was just aimless wandering. A 5.9 average rating? Deservedly abysmal. They should be ashamed of themselves. 

Spain, on the other hand, played with purpose. Morata's goal was the difference-maker, and his 8.6 rating is proof he was the only one on the field with any ambition. While their passing game could use some work, they managed to outshoot Portugal by a mile and secure the win. A 7.4 average rating shows they're a team that actually came to play. It's a well-deserved victory against an overrated opponent.</div>
