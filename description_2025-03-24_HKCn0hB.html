  <h1>Description for GCSE_Chemistry_-_Neutralisation_Reactions.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are 10 points summarizing the video:

1.  The video explains reactions between acids and different types of bases.
2.  Types of bases examined in the video: Metal oxides, metal hydroxides, and metal carbonates.
3.  Reactions between acids and bases are known as neutralization reactions.
4.  Metal oxides and metal hydroxides when reacted with acids, produce a salt plus water.
5.  Metal carbonates react with acids to make a salt, water, and carbon dioxide.
6.  For metal oxide and hydroxide + acid reactions: you take the negative ion from the acid, combine it with the positive ion from the base to form a salt and water. The chemical equation must be accurate and balanced.
7.  You can make soluble salts by reacting an acid with an insoluble base.
8.  A way to get pure soluble salt in practice: Place diluted acid in a beaker and gently heat it, then, add an insoluble base little by little. Add this insoluble base until it stops dissolving, and you know the base is in excess.
9.  After you reach that point, remove any excess solids from the solution with filter paper.
10. After that, you can gently heat up your pure solution of salt in a container to evaporate off some of the water to get purer crystals of your soluble salt. Then filter again to get the crystals and dry them.</div>
