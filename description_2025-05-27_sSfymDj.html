  <h1>Description for 10482.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. This is going to be brutal.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Aleksandr Zarutskiy:</strong> 3/10. Probably decent enough for a local league, but let's be honest, he's not striking fear into anyone's heart.
•   <strong>Temirlan Anarbekov:</strong> 2/10. If he's behind Zarutskiy, there's a reason. Likely a backup for backup's sake.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Egor Sorokin:</strong> 5/10. Probably the best of a very mediocre bunch. Likely past his prime but still brings a level of experience to the squad.
•   <strong>Luka Gadrani:</strong> 4/10. Probably not good enough to make a significant impact.
•   <strong>Damir Kasabulat:</strong> 3/10. Another local player who is unlikely to have the quality needed for a high-level league.
•   <strong>Aleksandr Martynovich:</strong> 5/10. Another aging player but he brings his experience to the team.
•   <strong>Aleksandr Shirobokov:</strong> 2/10. Looks like a name that will remain on the bench more often than on the field.
•   <strong>Luis Mata:</strong> 4/10. Potentially decent but he needs more consistency.
•   <strong>Lev Kurgin:</strong> 2/10. The chances of him being anything more than a squad filler are next to nothing.
•   <strong>Erkin Tapalov:</strong> 2/10. Same as Kurgin.
•   <strong>Aleksandr Mrynskiy:</strong> 2/10. Just a terrible defense overall.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Ofri Arad:</strong> 4/10. Most likely a midfielder with an average skill set.
•   <strong>Adilet Sadybekov:</strong> 3/10. A local midfielder, unlikely to be a game-changer.
•   <strong>Dan Glazer:</strong> 5/10. One of the better players but not good enough to carry the midfield.
•   <strong>Olzhas Baybek:</strong> 3/10. Doubt he would bring much creativity to the team.
•   <strong>Jug Stanojev:</strong> 4/10. Probably solid but lacks the killer instinct needed.
•   <strong>Valeriy Gromyko:</strong> 4/10. Another player who seems average at best.
•   <strong>Giorgi Zaria:</strong> 4/10. Good but not consistent.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ismail Bekbolat:</strong> 3/10. A local player in a weak attacking line.
•   <strong>Dastan Satpaev:</strong> 3/10. Another local player who's unlikely to set the league on fire.
•   <strong>João Paulo:</strong> 5/10. Should be the key man in attack, but that's not saying much.
•   <strong>Jorginho:</strong> 4/10. One of the main goal scorers, the team needs a better level of competition.
•   <strong>Élder Santana:</strong> 4/10. Probably another player who is more likely to warm the bench.
•   <strong>Ramazan Bagdat:</strong> 3/10. Will probably provide nothing going forward.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

2/10. This squad is a disaster waiting to happen. There's a distinct lack of quality, creativity, and any real firepower. The defense is leaky, the midfield is uninspired, and the attack is toothless. They're heavily reliant on aging players, and the local players simply aren't up to par. Unless they make drastic changes, they're in for a long and painful season. They are awful.</div>
