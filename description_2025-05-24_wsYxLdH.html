  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this lineup.

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Jordan Pickford (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Decent shot-stopper, but prone to errors and questionable decision-making.
•   <strong>Kyle Walker (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Pace is his strength, not much else to say.
•   <strong>Oleksandr Tymchyk (🇺🇦):</strong> 5/10. There are MUCH better defenders out there.
•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Incredible passer, defensively questionable. A liability in a back four, more suited for wingback.
•   <strong>Harry Maguire (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 3/10. A walking disaster waiting to happen. Slow, error-prone, and a confidence killer for any team.
•   <strong>Declan Rice (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 8/10. An absolute animal, a beast, a phenomenal defensive midfielder. A leader and workhorse, but needs more technical ability.
•   <strong>Jude Bellingham (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 9/10. An elite midfielder, and still only getting better. Could genuinely walk into any team in the world.
•   <strong>Jordan Henderson (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10. Past his prime. Offers experience, but lacks the legs and creativity needed in a modern midfield.
•   <strong>Hakan Çalhanoğlu (🇹🇷):</strong> 7/10. Underrated. Great set-piece delivery and technical ability. But is inconsistent, unfortunately.
•   <strong>Harry Kane (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 9/10. World-class striker. Clinical finisher, great passer. Near-complete forward.
•   <strong>Bukayo Saka (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 8/10. A menace to any defence. Quick, skillful, and direct.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

Overall Team Rating: 6/10.

This team has clear weaknesses in key areas. The defence, specifically the centre-back pairing of Maguire and Tymchyk, is a major concern. Also Henderson being in this team is a big concern due to his age, and how slow he is. While there's talent in midfield and attack, the lack of balance and defensive stability will ultimately let them down against top opposition. I can see them getting hammered.</div>
