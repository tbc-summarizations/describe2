  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these album covers. Buckle up, because no one is safe here.

1.  <strong>"Late Registration"</strong>: This cover looks like someone tried to fancy up a bunch of bleachers with some dollar-store cherubs and gold leaf. It's like the album art equivalent of a community college trying to look prestigious. Get over yourself, Kanye.

2.  <strong>"College Dropout"</strong>: So, you're telling me that success and education are mutually exclusive. It makes sense now as to why you're so proud and dumb.

3.  <strong>"Graduation"</strong>: Oh, wow, a colorful bear flying through the sky? Peak intellectualism. This looks like it was designed by a toddler on an iPad. Maybe you should have actually finished college instead of making this visual vomit.

4.  <strong>"808s &amp; Heartbreak"</strong>: A simple, somewhat anatomically correct heart? How groundbreaking! It's as emotionally stunted and monotone as the album itself. This cover is as deep as a puddle.

5.  <strong>"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"</strong>: Ah, the cover that tried so hard to be controversial. It's just pretentious and tame at the same time. This cover is trying way too hard, just like the album.

6.  <strong>"Watch the Throne"</strong>: This cover is a garish mess. It's like they took a bunch of expensive trash, threw it on a canvas, and called it "art." It perfectly encapsulates the album: loud, obnoxious, and ultimately meaningless.

7.  <strong>Blank CD Case</strong>: You didn't even try. This is lazy even for you. Are we supposed to admire the minimalist emptiness?

8.  <strong>"The Life of Pablo"</strong>: This cover is a visual representation of chaos. A terrible wedding photo slapped on top of a Kazakh flag? It's as disjointed and incoherent as the album itself. This looks like it was designed by a committee of people on meth.

9.  <strong>"Ye"</strong>: Oh, look, mountains. How profound. The only thing more basic than this cover is the music inside.

10. <strong>Arabic Calligraphy</strong>: This is just lazy. What does this even mean? Stop trying to be so cryptic and just make some decent music for once.

There you go. I laid into these album covers with no mercy. Let me know if you have any other requests!</div>
