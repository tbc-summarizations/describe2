  <h1>Description for 15299.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of Zhetisu's squad. I'm not pulling any punches:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Denis Kavlinov (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Probably decent enough for the Kazakh league, but I doubt he's a world-beater. 5/10
â€¢   <strong>Mikhail Golubnichiy (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Likely a backup, probably average at best. 4/10

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Maksim Kovel (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> Belarusian defender in Kazakhstan? Smells like a journeyman. Probably solid, but nothing special. 5/10
â€¢   <strong>Timur Rudoselskiy (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Local player, likely a squad filler. 4/10
â€¢   <strong>Sultan Askarov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Another Kazakh, probably similar to Rudoselskiy. 4/10
â€¢   <strong>Soslan Takulov (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Russian, probably a bit better than the locals, but not a game-changer. 6/10
â€¢   <strong>Maksat Taykenov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Depth player. 3/10
â€¢   <strong>Berik Shaykhov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> More depth. 3/10
â€¢   <strong>Ramazan Karimov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Even more depth. 2/10
â€¢   <strong>Dmitriy Schmidt (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Okay, this is getting ridiculous. 2/10
â€¢   <strong>Aslan Akhmedov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> I'm sure he's a lovely guy. 2/10

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Meik Karwot (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª):</strong> German in Kazakhstan? Either a washed-up player trying to revive his career or someone who never had one. I'd be surprised if he's above average. 5/10
â€¢   <strong>Zhansultan Mukhametkhanov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Kazakh midfielder, probably nothing special. 4/10
â€¢   <strong>Rinat Serikkul (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> More of the same. 4/10
â€¢   <strong>David Esimbekov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> You guessed it, 4/10
â€¢   <strong>Zhaslan Kairkenov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> I'm starting to feel bad for these guys. 3/10
â€¢   <strong>Saidu Fofanah (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡±):</strong> Sierra Leonean? Could be a diamond in the rough, or just another average player. Let's be optimistic and say 5/10
â€¢   <strong>Miras Omatay (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Okay, I'm officially bored with these Kazakh midfielders. 3/10
â€¢   <strong>Alan Chochiev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Russian midfielder, maybe a bit more technical. 6/10

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Dias Orynbasar (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Probably can't hit the broad side of a barn. 3/10
â€¢   <strong>Alen Aymanov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> Another Kazakh forward? Don't expect goals. 4/10
â€¢   <strong>Nurbergen Nurbol (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> I'm sensing a pattern here. 3/10
â€¢   <strong>Ruslan Bolov (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Russian forward, might have a bit of skill. 6/10
â€¢   <strong>Maksim Zhitnev (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º):</strong> Another Russian. Probably a decent finisher. 6/10

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

Taking everything into account, this squad is looking like a solid <strong>4/10</strong>. They're probably fighting relegation. A few journeymen, a bunch of average locals, and not a single player that makes you go "wow." Good luck to them, they'll need it.</div>
