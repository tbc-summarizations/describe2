  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the roast of the image you provided:

This image looks like the unedited, unfiltered stream of consciousness of someone who just discovered texting slang and is trying way too hard to sound cool. It's like they're trying to cram every abbreviation they know into one giant, messy word salad. The sad, broken heart on top just screams "I'm emotionally stunted and using internet jargon to mask my feelings." This isn't deep, it's just confusing and frankly, a little pathetic. If this is how you communicate, please seek therapy. And maybe a dictionary.</div>
