  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's how Wolfenstein 2 would be different if Dr. Gregory House were the main character instead of B.J. Blazkowicz, and I'm not holding back:

<strong>The Story</strong>

Instead of a straight-up Nazi-killing rampage, the plot would revolve around House reluctantly uncovering a vast conspiracy behind the Nazi regime's advanced technology. He wouldn't care about liberating America; he'd be driven by a perverse need to solve the ultimate medical puzzle: "What the hell is wrong with these people that they thought this was a good idea?"

<strong>Character Interactions</strong>

•   <strong>Anya Oliwa:</strong> Instead of a loving relationship, House would constantly diagnose Anya with some obscure ailment, even during intimate moments. "That shortness of breath...could be early-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Have you been around asbestos lately?"
•   <strong>Caroline Becker:</strong> House would be openly contemptuous of her cybernetic enhancements. "Seriously? You let them turn you into a cyborg? That's just lazy medicine. Diet and exercise, woman!"
•   <strong>Set Roth:</strong> House would constantly challenge Roth's scientific theories, trying to poke holes in his explanations of advanced technology. "So, you're telling me this laser weapon is powered by 'interdimensional particles'? Sounds like a load of poppycock to me."
•   <strong>Fergus or Wyatt:</strong> House would use them as lab rats. He'd probably inject them with experimental drugs just to see what happens. "Don't worry, lads. It's probably not lupus."

<strong>Gameplay</strong>

•   <strong>Weapons:</strong> House wouldn't use the standard arsenal. Instead, he'd wield a cane as his primary weapon, delivering crippling blows to Nazi kneecaps. He'd also have a medical kit filled with syringes and vials of mystery substances, which he could use to temporarily incapacitate enemies (or, you know, make them see things).
•   <strong>Stealth:</strong> Forget stealth; House would prefer to use his sardonic wit to verbally dismantle the Nazi troops. "You're telling me you signed up for <em>this</em>? You must have a severe lack of critical thinking skills. Maybe I can get you into a clinical trial."
•   <strong>Upgrades:</strong> Instead of enhancing his physical abilities, House would upgrade his diagnostic skills. He'd gain the ability to identify enemy weaknesses with a glance, allowing him to target specific body parts for maximum pain and suffering.
•   <strong>Boss Battles:</strong> Instead of intense firefights, boss battles would be extended arguments where House uses his superior intellect to psychologically break down the Nazi commanders.

<strong>Tone</strong>

The game would be significantly darker and more cynical. Expect lots of black humor, moral ambiguity, and philosophical debates about the nature of good and evil. There would be significantly more drug use and abuse as the game goes on.

In short, it would be a disturbing, hilarious, and deeply unsettling take on the Wolfenstein formula.</div>
