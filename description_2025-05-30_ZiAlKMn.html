  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest, no-holds-barred reaction to these matches:

<strong>2W 1L Group:</strong>

•   <strong>Wales vs. Austria:</strong> Wales scraping by against Austria? Both teams are mediocre at best. Neither deserves to be in a serious tournament.

•   <strong>France vs. Iceland:</strong> France actually playing like they're worth a damn. Iceland got rightfully hammered, as they should. They had their 5 minutes of fame, now back to irrelevance.

•   <strong>Denmark vs. Hungary:</strong> Denmark got absolutely humiliated at home. Deservedly so. Hungary might actually be a team to watch if they keep this up.

•   <strong>Portugal vs. Croatia:</strong> Portugal doing what they're expected to do. Croatia is showing their age. Time for a rebuild, old-timers.

•   <strong>Spain vs. Italy:</strong> Spain is a joke. Losing to Italy? Embarrassing. Italy is consistently better, though still overrated.

•   <strong>Turkey vs. Romania:</strong> Turkey winning on penalties? How original. Two equally forgettable teams. Who cares?

<strong>1W 2L Group:</strong>

•   <strong>Sweden vs. Albania:</strong> Sweden barely scraping a win against Albania? Pathetic. Both teams are going nowhere.

•   <strong>Slovenia vs. Norway:</strong> Slovenia beating Norway? Haaland can't carry them all alone. Norway is all hype, no substance.

•   <strong>Scotland vs. Germany:</strong> Scotland getting destroyed by Germany? As expected. Germany is actually playing like Germany again. Scotland is perpetually awful.

•   <strong>Greece vs. North Macedonia:</strong> Greece losing to North Macedonia? What a fall from grace. Both teams are irrelevant on the European stage.

•   <strong>Czechia vs. Bosnia:</strong> Czechia winning on penalties against Bosnia? Two teams nobody cares about. Both are destined for obscurity.

•   <strong>Georgia vs. Finland:</strong> Georgia losing to Finland? Predictable. Neither team has any chance of making a serious impact.

Overall, this round of matches showcases a lot of mediocrity. Some of the bigger teams are starting to show up, but there's a lot of dead weight here. Some teams need a serious overhaul, and others just need to accept their fate as perennial losers.</div>
