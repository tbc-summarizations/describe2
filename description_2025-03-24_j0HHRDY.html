  <div class="discord-text">Alright, listen up, Kazakhstan national team. This recent performance has been an embarrassment. 3-0, 4-0, 0-1, 0-2, 5-0, 3-1 – these aren't scores, these are surrender flags. This isn't the spirit of the Kazakh people I know.

Forget this pity party. It's time to man up and get your heads out of your asses. No more excuses. No more blaming the ref, the weather, or the damn pitch. You control your effort, your discipline, and your performance.

Here's how you turn this around:

1.  <strong>Conditioning is Non-Negotiable:</strong> Run until you puke. Train until your legs cramp. If you're not exhausted after every session, you're wasting your time. We need warriors on that field, not lazy amateurs.
2.  <strong>Defense That Bites:</strong> Tackles harder than granite. Mark your men tighter than a drum. Anticipate every pass, intercept every ball, and let the opposition know they're in for a goddamn war. No more soft touches or half-hearted challenges. Be ruthless!
3.  <strong>Attack With Savage Intent:</strong> Every shot should be a missile aimed at the back of the net. No more timid passes or hoping for a lucky bounce. Drive forward, break the lines, and make the opposition bleed. Demand the ball and make something happen!
4.  <strong>Discipline, Discipline, Discipline:</strong> No stupid fouls. No childish arguments. No losing your heads under pressure. Control your emotions and execute the game plan. You are soldiers on the field, not spoiled brats.
5.  <strong>Team Before Self:</strong> No glory-hogging. No selfishness. Play for each other. Sacrifice for each other. Cover for each other. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so make sure every man is pulling his weight.

The 2026 World Cup is the goal. It will not be handed to you. It will be earned through blood, sweat, and relentless dedication. Believe in yourselves, believe in your team, and believe in Kazakhstan. Now get out there and make it happen. You have no more excuses!

Kazakhstan вперед! Show the world what you're made of!</div>
