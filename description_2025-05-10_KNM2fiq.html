  <h1>Description for gsbLjfrwUW4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The user is asking for a description of a Five Nights at Freddy's object show, which this is:

The story is a bit nonsensical and involves a bunch of different characters from video games and the object show genre. The show is broken into different seasons, and involves a conflict with an evil character name RBG who is trying to harm others. At first it appears that RBG has been defeated, but he then appears as an undead version. The heroes are sucked into the world of FNaF, and now have to battle the animatronics. A bonus scene includes one of the heroes being manipulated into poisoning a new enemy. It seems that this character (Thanos) becomes an enemy in his own right, as the heroes find themselves confronting him on Mars at a later date.</div>
