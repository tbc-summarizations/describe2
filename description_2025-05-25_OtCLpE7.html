  <h1>Description for 1024px-Newcastle_United_Logo.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rundown of the Newcastle squad:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Eddie Howe (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. He's done a decent job stabilizing the team and getting them into Europe, but he's tactically limited and doesn't have a clear plan B when things go wrong. Overrated by Newcastle fans.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>John Ruddy (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 2/10. Backup. Nothing more to say.
•   <strong>Martin Dubravka (🇸🇰):</strong> 5/10. Decent shot-stopper but inconsistent. Prone to mistakes. Should not be starting for a team with ambitions.
•   <strong>Mark Gillespie (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 1/10. Why is he even on the squad?
•   <strong>Nick Pope (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7.5/10. Very good shot stopper, but injured a lot.
•   <strong>Odisseas Vlachodimos (🇬🇷):</strong> 5/10. Average goalkeeper that's unlikely to replace the already average Dubravka.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Kieran Trippier (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 8/10. Class player. Still very good.
•   <strong>Valentino Livramento (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Promising but needs to stay healthy. Could be a top player in the future.
•   <strong>Daniel Burn (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. A solid, reliable player, can cover many roles.
•   <strong>Fabian Schär (🇨🇭):</strong> 7/10. Good passer, prone to defensive lapses. Aging.
•   <strong>Emil Krafth (🇸🇪):</strong> 3/10. Not good enough for a team trying to compete in Europe.
•   <strong>Jamaal Lascelles (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 4/10. Not good enough anymore.
•   <strong>Sven Botman (🇳🇱):</strong> 8/10. Solid player. Needs more time to improve his potential.
•   <strong>Matt Targett (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10. Below average.
•   <strong>Jamal Lewis (🇬🇧):</strong> 2/10. Total flop. Should be sold.
•   <strong>Lewis Hall (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10. Not ready yet.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Joelinton (🇧🇷):</strong> 7/10. Physical player, sometimes clumsy. Overrated by fans due to his work rate.
•   <strong>Sean Longstaff (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Limited player. Good backup.
•   <strong>Bruno Guimaraes (🇧🇷):</strong> 9/10. The only world-class player in the squad. Carries the midfield.
•   <strong>Joseph Willock (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Can be good in attack, but lacks consistency. Inured a lot.
•   <strong>Sandro Tonali (🇮🇹):</strong> N/A (suspended) - When available, he's an 8/10.
•   <strong>Lewis Miley (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Promising young player but needs time.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Jacob Murphy (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10. Average.
•   <strong>Harvey Barnes (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Can be a good scorer.
•   <strong>Anthony Gordon (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7/10. Good dribbler.
•   <strong>Garang Kuol (🇦🇺):</strong> 2/10. Not ready.
•   <strong>Trevan Sanusi (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> N/A - Too young to rate.
•   <strong>Callum Wilson (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7.5/10. Great finisher but injured way too often.
•   <strong>Alexander Isak (🇸🇪):</strong> 8.5/10. Good player.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

<strong>6.5/10.</strong>

The squad lacks depth in defense and is heavily reliant on a few key players like Guimaraes and Isak. Injuries always ruin games. Without Tonali, the midfield creativity is seriously lacking. Too many average players and not enough true quality to compete at the highest level.</div>
