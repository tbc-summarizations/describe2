  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my honest, brutal, and far-from-neutral assessment of these Euro group stage standings:

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Germany:</strong> Honestly, scraping by with a bunch of draws? Not exactly the dominant display you'd expect. Get your act together, or you'll be out quicker than you can say "Autobahn."
•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> Yawn. Another team happy to settle for ties. Predictable and boring.
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> How do you draw three games and still look so utterly uninspired? You're the definition of mediocre.
•   <strong>Greece:</strong> Congratulations, you managed one draw. That's your tournament highlight. Pack your bags.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> Finally, some actual winning! But don't get cocky, the real test is yet to come.
•   <strong>England:</strong> One loss? Seriously? Overhyped and underperforming as usual. Sort yourselves out before you choke again.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> A single win isn't enough to save you from being completely forgettable.
•   <strong>Austria:</strong> Three losses. Absolute disaster. Might as well have stayed home.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> Finally, a team that gets it! Three wins, no messing around. The others need to step up their game!
•   <strong>France:</strong> One slip-up isn't the end of the world, but you need to rediscover that killer instinct. No more excuses!
•   <strong>Poland:</strong> One win against who? Probably some minnow. Time to head back to your pierogi.
•   <strong>Czechia:</strong> Three losses? You're a national embarrassment. At least try to put up a fight next time.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>Spain:</strong> Okay, decent showing, but still not the vintage Spain we know and hate to love.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> Draws, really? Get Ronaldo to fire things up or you're going nowhere.
•   <strong>Italy:</strong> One win? You're supposed to be a footballing giant, not a lukewarm has-been. This tournament's going to be tough for you.
•   <strong>Scotland:</strong> Three losses, no wins. You're the laughingstock of the group. Time to go home and get drunk.</div>
