  <div class="discord-text">Alright fam, let me be so real with you, innit? This video is straight tapped, wallahi. You got the big man there, looking like he just walked outta the gym, but he's giving "big booms" for someone's dead brother. On my life, the boy beside him looks proper calm, but that sticker ting on his head? Bruv, that's just cold. I can't lie, the whole thing is wet, the intentions there are kinda okay but bro like you should know giving booms to someone that died, it ain't safe, it's more just mad weird. 

Say no more g, this is big man ting, you see this video it's like bro, the guy is just trying to cheer up someone who lost their fam and he really tryna to make em safe, he's like yo man you lost ur bro but imma give him them booms, that will make him calm. This vid goes too cold, you see the kid, say nothing, you know? That is what it is, the kid is like bro calm, give them booms and ill be so real ill hit them for you. Safe.</div>
