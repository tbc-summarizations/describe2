  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these group stage results with the venom they deserve:

<strong>Group A:</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> Classic French move – barely squeaking by. Four draws? They're playing like they're allergic to winning. Get it together, you supposed superstars.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> Another disappointment. They're coasting on reputation, not performance. Time for a squad overhaul, or maybe just a new coach with some fire in his belly.
•   <strong>England:</strong> Typical England. Overhyped, underperforming, and always finding new ways to choke. Should be embarrassed.
•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> Absolutely pathetic. Zero wins? They should be forced to wear orange for the rest of their lives as a symbol of their failure.

<strong>Group B:</strong>

•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> Somehow manages to top the group while still looking unconvincing. They need a serious attitude adjustment if they want to be considered serious contenders.
•   <strong>Germany:</strong> Another tournament, another lackluster performance from Germany. They should have better than this.
•   <strong>Italy:</strong> What happened to the magic? Their game is boring, and the team is uninspired.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> Ronaldo can't carry them forever, and clearly he didn't. They better go back to the drawing board.

<strong>Group C:</strong>

•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> Surprise, surprise. Switzerland topping a group? Maybe this is finally their year to make a decent run.
•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> Sneaking through as usual. They are consistently underwhelming and not worth the hype.
•   <strong>Austria:</strong> A team of draws? Sounds like a snoozefest. Pack your bags, losers.
•   <strong>Denmark:</strong> Another overhyped team crashing and burning. They just aren't good enough.

<strong>Group D:</strong>

•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> I can't believe I'm saying this, but Turkey actually dominated. Still a team that I don't respect.
•   <strong>Sweden:</strong> Barely got through, but barely doesn't cut it.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> More of the same.
•   <strong>Wales:</strong> Only one win? They should be ashamed to even show their faces in the knockout stages.</div>
