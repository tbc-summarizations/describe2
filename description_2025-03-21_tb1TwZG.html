  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of how safe each of those countries are for LGBTQ+ people, on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being extremely unsafe, 10 being very safe):

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 6/10 - While they have some legal protections and recognition of same-sex partnerships, social acceptance can be hit-or-miss, and violence/discrimination still happen.

•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 1/10 - Being openly LGBTQ+ there is incredibly dangerous. There are no legal protections and the social climate is very hostile. You're basically risking arrest and persecution.

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 8/10 - England has a generally positive legal landscape and social climate for LGBTQ+ people. There's still some discrimination, but overall it's relatively safe.

•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 3/10 - Bosnia is not a good place to be openly LGBTQ+. Laws aren't enforced and societal attitudes are extremely conservative, with little to no tolerance.

•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 1/10 - It's actively dangerous to be LGBTQ+ in Malaysia. There are laws against same-sex relations, and the social environment is intensely homophobic.

•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 3/10 - Peru has some legal protections, but they aren't well-enforced. Social acceptance is low, and discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals are common.

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 3/10 - Poland is becoming increasingly hostile. While there are no specific laws against LGBTQ+ people, the ruling party and the Catholic Church fuel discrimination and hate.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 2/10 - LGBTQ+ rights are practically non-existent. Homophobia is rampant, and there are no legal protections. It's unsafe to be openly LGBTQ+ in Kazakhstan.

•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 7/10 - Estonia is one of the more progressive former Soviet countries. While same-sex marriage isn't legal, registered partnerships are, and there's a growing level of social acceptance.

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 4/10 - Serbia is pretty bad, laws are not well enforced and there are very few legal protections for LGBTQ+ people. Social intolerance is high.</div>
