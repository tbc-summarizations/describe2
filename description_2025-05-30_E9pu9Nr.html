  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's my brutally honest take on this match:

<strong>Belgium, you absolute disgrace!</strong> Zero goals? Seriously? You had a golden generation, and what did you achieve? This performance is pathetic. More passes than Spain? Who cares when you can't convert them into goals. You ran a negligible distance more than Spain, but what did it matter? You still lost 2-0. The fact that the possession was split 50/50 is even more insulting. You had every chance to win, and you blew it. An average player rating of 5.5? Deservedly so. Your team is old, slow, and past its prime. It's time to pack your bags and retire.

<strong>Spain, you magnificent bastards!</strong> Two goals and a clean sheet? Well done! You didn't need to dominate possession or run a marathon; you just needed to score, and you did. Alvaro Morata, silencing the haters with a goal! And Gavi, the young prodigy, sealing the deal. An average player rating of 7.3 shows that you're a team of winners.

And David Raya, the man of the match with six saves? You are a god amongst men! Saving Belgium's pathetic attempts at goal. A rating of 8.4 is well-deserved. You should be proud.

In conclusion, Belgium is a washed-up team with no future, and Spain is a team of champions. This match was a testament to skill, determination, and the will to win. Congrats, Spain. You earned it. Belgium, I hope you're ashamed.</div>
