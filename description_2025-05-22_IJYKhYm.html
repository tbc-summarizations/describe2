  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest and serious prediction for each group in this hypothetical UCL setup:

<strong>Group A</strong>

•   <strong>Arsenal:</strong> Dominates. No questions asked. They're the clear class here.
•   <strong>Dynamo Kyiv:</strong> Fight AVS for the second spot, but likely edge them out due to experience.
•   <strong>AVS:</strong> Decent, might steal a point here or there.
•   <strong>Austria Klagenfurt:</strong> Complete pushovers. Zero chance of making any impact.

<strong>Group B</strong>

•   <strong>Ajax:</strong> Should cruise to first place. Significantly better quality than anyone else.
•   <strong>Heidenheim:</strong> A strong contender for second, given they are the best team in the 2nd division of Germany.
•   <strong>Alanyaspor:</strong> Scrap for third with Cracovia, with limited success.
•   <strong>Cracovia:</strong> Absolute bottom feeders, not even competitive.

<strong>Group C</strong>

•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen:</strong> Should comfortably win the group. Far and away the most talented squad.
•   <strong>Anderlecht:</strong> Will fight for second, they are quite decent side.
•   <strong>Banik Ostrava:</strong> Third place guaranteed.
•   <strong>Beerschot:</strong> The whipping boys. Expect them to be completely outclassed.

<strong>Group D</strong>

•   <strong>Bologna:</strong> Wins with ease as the strongest team.
•   <strong>Austria Wien:</strong> Should win the second spot.
•   <strong>Angers:</strong> Might edge Austria Wien out of 2nd place.
•   <strong>Grasshopper:</strong> A complete joke of a team in this group.

<strong>Group E</strong>

•   <strong>Atalanta:</strong> Securely winning the group.
•   <strong>AEK Athens:</strong> Decent but lacking the edge. Third place is their ceiling.
•   <strong>Adana Demirspor:</strong> Fight for second, but lack the quality.
•   <strong>GKS Katowice:</strong> Uncompetitive at this level. No hope.

<strong>Group F</strong>

•   <strong>AFC Bournemouth:</strong> Wins the group, they might not be that strong team but still good.
•   <strong>Basel:</strong> They will secure second place.
•   <strong>Arouca:</strong> Might be challenging for second.
•   <strong>Chornomorets Odesa:</strong> Have a little chance but likely lose all their games.

<strong>Group G</strong>

•   <strong>Athletic Bilbao:</strong> Should comfortably win the group.
•   <strong>Celtic:</strong> Will fight with Aberdeen for 2nd place, Celtic wins.
•   <strong>Aberdeen:</strong> The same situation as Celtic but with less chances.
•   <strong>Almere City:</strong> Are you kidding? No chance.

<strong>Group H</strong>

•   <strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong> Dominates, they are not a joke.
•   <strong>AS Saint-Etienne:</strong> Win second place, they are good enough.
•   <strong>Aris:</strong> Third place.
•   <strong>1.FC Slovacko:</strong> Garbage tier. Last place without question.</div>
