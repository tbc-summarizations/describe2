  <h1>Description for ThO-vXpzZdo</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, get ready for this trainwreck of an object show's plot:

We start with our host, a cheap triangle knock-off, introducing the "fifth" episode, but he's immediately called out for being wrong – it's actually the sixth. This sets the stage for a theme of incompetence and lack of self-awareness.

Then we get intros from our contestants:

•   <strong>Dekoder:</strong> a countryball character who thinks he's "so pro."
•   <strong>Pleaseun\_banhenry:</strong> A Kazak soldier Roblox guy who is extremely full of himself.
•   <strong>United Airlines Flight 93:</strong> A plane that denies anything happened to it on 9/11.
•   <strong>Stickman:</strong> Some guy that is not from fnaf.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> A countryball who is the greatest country in the world.
•   <strong>Emoji:</strong> A smiling emoji who can become whatever he wants,
•   <strong>Meethexep:</strong> A cat who likes meth.
•   <strong>Neshtek:</strong> A rich pigeon that gets all the bitches.
•   <strong>Venus and Agar.io:</strong> Both the OG's.
•   <strong>Apple:</strong> An OG but no he's not.
•   <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy:</strong> A Ukrainian president

The first challenge is messed up: to kill yourself. Of course, Emoji wins, his team is safe, and the other team, which includes Dekoder, is up for elimination.

Dekoder's reaction is priceless, getting enraged someone won so quickly. He says f words.
The host triangle then says you can vote for who you want to be eliminated.</div>
