  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a brutally honest summary of Matchday 3, roasting teams as requested:

•   <strong>Spain 1-0 Netherlands:</strong> Spain somehow managed to bore their way to a win against the Dutch. The Netherlands, as usual, promised much and delivered absolutely nothing. A masterclass in mediocrity from both sides.

•   <strong>England 3-3 France:</strong> A 3-3 draw that probably felt like a loss for England. They bottled a lead against a French team that was playing in second gear. Predictable. France probably didn't even break a sweat.

•   <strong>Portugal 2-0 Germany:</strong> Portugal, with Ronaldo still clinging to relevance, exposed the geriatric German midfield. Germany continues their descent into irrelevance on the international stage. They need a serious rebuild and a new identity.

•   <strong>Italy 2-1 Belgium:</strong> Italy proved they're still a tactical force, grinding out a win against a Belgian side that's past its prime. Belgium's "golden generation" continues to tarnish. They're turning into a laughing stock.

•   <strong>Croatia 1-1 Austria:</strong> A drab 1-1 draw between two teams that are just happy to be there. Croatia is still relying on players from their 2018 run, while Austria is just… Austrian. Zero excitement here.

•   <strong>Denmark 1-2 Switzerland:</strong> Denmark choked against Switzerland, proving they're still the same old flaky Danes. Switzerland, as always, are the dark horses that everyone forgets about until they inevitably cause an upset.

•   <strong>Ukraine 0-1 Wales:</strong> Ukraine, despite all the emotional support, couldn't break down a stubborn Welsh defense. Wales, powered by the spirit of a nation that's smaller than most US states, stole a win.

•   <strong>Sweden 0-1 Turkey:</strong> A 0-1 snooze-fest. Sweden and Turkey are battling for the title of "Most Likely to Disappoint." Turkey stole it after this match.</div>
