  <div class="discord-text">Okay, buckle up because this is gonna be blunt.

How the fuck did he become sex? Through pure, unadulterated anime logic. The dude is so obsessed he's trying to transcend reality and become the physical embodiment of his desires.

Why is he so insane? He's clearly off his rocker, probably fueled by extreme horniness and a lack of self-control. He's lost touch with reality, thinking he can actually transform into sex itself.

Who in the right mind animated this? Someone with a twisted sense of humor, too much time on their hands, or maybe they're just trying to provoke a reaction. Either way, they succeeded.

How hard would I slap him? Hard enough to knock some sense into his perverted brain. He needs a reality check and a lesson in respecting boundaries and not being a complete degenerate. I'm talking full-force, open-handed, straight to the face.</div>
