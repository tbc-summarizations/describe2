  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of that Premier League Team of the Season lineup, player by player, and then as a whole:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Jordan Pickford:</strong> 5/10. He's a decent shot-stopper, but prone to blunders and lacks the composure of a top-tier keeper. Everton's consistently leaky defense inflates his save numbers, but he's not a game-changer.

•   <strong>Antonee Robinson:</strong> 6/10. Solid, athletic, but not a standout player. He's got pace and can defend well enough, but he's not creating anything special going forward.

•   <strong>Josko Gvardiol:</strong> 7/10. A promising defender, but hasn't yet reached his full potential. He's good in the air and on the ground, but sometimes gets caught out of position.

•   <strong>Virgil van Dijk:</strong> 7/10. He is a great center back but not in 2018 form. His pace has decreased and can no longer handle fast and agile attackers.

•   <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold:</strong> 8/10. World-class passer and playmaker from right-back. But his defensive vulnerabilities are still a liability. Relies too heavily on his attacking contributions to justify his spot.

•   <strong>Bruno Fernandes:</strong> 7/10. Can create and score goals. Has decent creativity but can do better and can get quite whiny and loses possession too often.

•   <strong>Moises Caicedo:</strong> 6/10. Good but not great in a weak Chelsea midfield. His work rate is strong but his decision-making and passing need to improve.

•   <strong>Bryan Mbeumo:</strong> 7/10. Underrated player but not an exceptional team of the season quality. His pace, power, and finishing are dangerous but lacks consistency.

•   <strong>Cole Palmer:</strong> 8/10. A revelation at Chelsea. His creativity, dribbling, and finishing are top-notch. But still a bit raw and needs to show he can maintain this level over a longer period.

•   <strong>Mohamed Salah:</strong> 9/10. Still a world-class goalscorer and creator. His output might fluctuate, but his threat is always there. Deserves to be in the team of the season.

•   <strong>Erling Haaland:</strong> 7/10. A goal machine, but heavily reliant on service. If the team doesn't create enough chances, he can go missing. Other strikers offer more all-around play.

<strong>Overall Team Rating: 7/10</strong>

This team has some serious attacking firepower and creativity, but it's defensively suspect, especially in the midfield. They'd score a lot of goals, but they'd also concede a fair few. The midfield pairing lacks the steel and discipline needed to protect the back four adequately. This lineup is exciting but ultimately unbalanced and would struggle against more tactically astute teams.</div>
