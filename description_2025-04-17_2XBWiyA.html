  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here is an essay on Kanye West as a contestant in an object show, including the requested sections and my brutally honest opinions:

## Kanye West: A Delusional Ego Trip

Kanye West, or "Ye" as he sometimes insists on being called, would be a disaster as a contestant on any object show. His inflated ego and detachment from reality would make him an unbearable presence and a hindrance to any team he's on.

<strong>General Information:</strong>

•   <strong>Contestant Name:</strong> Kanye West
•   <strong>Object Type:</strong> A photograph of Kanye West
•   <strong>Catchphrase:</strong> (Most likely) "I'm the greatest contestant of all time" or some other self-aggrandizing statement.
•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Probably none when it comes to teamwork and challenges.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Delusional ego, inability to follow instructions, prone to tantrums, and a complete lack of self-awareness.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Kanye West is represented by a photograph of himself wearing casual clothes. The photograph looks fine but it's just a picture of an arrogant jerk.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Kanye's personality is his biggest downfall. He is arrogant, self-centered, and utterly convinced of his own superiority. He interrupts challenges to give unsolicited opinions, blames others for his failures, and constantly demands special treatment. He's the kind of contestant who would declare himself the winner even if he loses every single challenge. His inability to listen to others or acknowledge his own flaws would quickly make him the most hated contestant. 

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

In terms of objective abilities, Kanye is basically useless. He lacks physical prowess and probably cannot be bothered to listen to instructions, so his team's chances of winning would plummet whenever he's involved. His only "ability" would be his delusion of grandeur, which he would try to use to intimidate other contestants.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

0/10. He would ruin the show with his egotistical antics and completely lack of any redeeming qualities. Honestly, his elimination needs to be the first one.</div>
