<strong>2W 1L Bracket</strong>

•   <strong>Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 vs. Austria 🇦🇹</strong>: Wales, despite a good run, is ultimately limited in quality. Austria, while inconsistent, has moments of brilliance.

    <strong>Prediction:</strong> Wales 1 - 3 Austria.

    <strong>Prediction</strong>: France 5 - 0 Iceland.

•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 vs. Hungary 🇭🇺</strong>: Denmark's organization and attacking prowess give them a clear edge. Hungary will struggle to contain them.

    <strong>Prediction:</strong> Denmark 3 - 1 Hungary.

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹 vs. Croatia 🇭🇷</strong>: A clash of veterans. Portugal's Ronaldo still poses a significant threat, and their midfield is stronger.

    <strong>Prediction</strong>: Portugal 2 - 1 Croatia.

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸 vs. Italy 🇮🇹</strong>: A tactical battle. Spain's possession-based style against Italy's defensive solidity. Italy's grit and counter-attacking threat will prevail.

    <strong>Prediction</strong>: Spain 1 - 2 Italy.

•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 vs. Romania 🇷🇴</strong>: A tense affair. Turkey's passionate fans and slightly better players will give them the edge.
