  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's dissect this squad with brutal honesty.

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> N/A - <strong>Rating: 0/10</strong> (No keeper, no chance)
•   <strong>Salem al-Hazmi (LB):</strong> Disciplined and good at tracking back is decent, but in today's football, you need more going forward. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Khalid al-Mihdhar (CB):</strong> Strong in the air and a good tackler. Classic center-back attributes, but potentially lacks pace. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ahmed al-Ghamdi (CB):</strong> Composed and organizes the defense well. Good leadership qualities are important. <strong>Rating: 6.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Nawaf al-Hazmi (RB):</strong> Energetic and contributes to attacks. Sounds promising, but could be a defensive liability. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Satam al-Suqami (DM):</strong> Breaks up plays and protects the defense. A pure destroyer, useful but limited. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Marwan al-Shehhi (CM):</strong> Creative playmaker, dictates tempo. The key to the team's creativity. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ziad Jarrah (CM):</strong> Box-to-box, contributes defensively and offensively. A good all-rounder. <strong>Rating: 6.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Wail al-Shehri (LW):</strong> Direct, pacey, good at cutting inside. A threat on the wing. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>
•   <strong>Mohamed Atta (ST):</strong> Clinical finisher, excellent positioning. A goalscorer is always valuable. <strong>Rating: 7.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Hani Hanjour (RW):</strong> Skillful dribbler, can take on defenders. Adds flair and unpredictability. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong>

<strong>Substitutes:</strong>

•   Waleed al-Shehri (Versatile forward): 6/10
•   Fayez Banihammad (Solid defender): 5/10
•   Mohand al-Shehri (Energetic midfielder): 5.5/10
•   Hamza al-Ghamdi (Pacey winger): 6/10
• Ahmed al-Haznawi (Backup for Midfield): 4/10
• Ahmed al-Nami (Backup for Defense): 4/10
• Saeed al-Ghamdi (Backup for defense): 4/10
• Majed Moqed (Backup for defense): 4/10
• Abdulaziz al-Omari (Versatile forward): 5/10

<strong>Overall Team Rating (Out of 10):</strong>

<strong>4/10</strong>

<strong>Brutal Analysis:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeping Catastrophe:</strong> No goalkeeper is unforgivable.
•   <strong>Defensive Vulnerabilities:</strong> The defense is solid but lacks pace. Could get exposed against fast, modern attacks.
•   <strong>Midfield Potential:</strong> The midfield pairing of al-Shehhi and Jarrah is promising, providing creativity and energy.
•   <strong>Attack is Decent:</strong> The front three has a good mix of pace, skill, and finishing ability. They would scare some defenders.
•   <strong>Subs are Average:</strong> The subs are nothing to get excited about.
•   <strong>Tactical Concerns:</strong> The team might lack tactical flexibility.
•   <strong>Overall:</strong> This team would struggle against a well-organized opponent. Without a goalkeeper, it's a guaranteed loss. The midfield and attack have potential, but the defense and lack of depth are major weaknesses.</div>
