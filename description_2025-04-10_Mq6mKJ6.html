  <div class="discord-text">Oh wow, thanks for saving me Neshtek!
No problem!
Anyways it's time to see who which one of you gets eliminated, you naughty boys.
Okay so, we got 13 votes.
We finally reached the pop ten!
Those who are safe gets pah and those won it will get bohard aka eliminated.
So, there's only one person who got zero votes and that's Kazakhstan.
Phew
Second time
Whatever
Now at least all of you received more than one vote.
But one vote goes to Please Unban Henry.
So he's safe.
Phew
Meeth's time even though you're a cat, you got two votes.
So you're safe.
Phew
Hey guys, it's me zis.
Oh shit!
That's my Marshall's just installed firmware 3.0 beta in line hither and today we're gonna give some
Whatever, so it's now down to Decoder and Zelensky
You got anything to say to Decoder?
Oh Nyet, I might get ustraini.
Exactly! Decoder is safe with three votes.
And Zelensky is eliminated with seven votes.
Phew
Oh no Zelensky, you got eliminated
Yeah!
Oh, so let me say my final speech for weird as shit.
My time for elimination has come, and well I wish the best of my team.
Hey, you could have let him finish his sentence.
Why do you care?
Oh I'm so glad you're safe Decoder.
Thanks
All right so, the fourth challenge is to escape from furries.
You have to run away from furries as fast as you can, and hide somewhere that they can't find you so they chase the other team.
The first team that successfully gets them selves hidden from the furries wins.
And the other team will be up for elimination
Go.

Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota.
