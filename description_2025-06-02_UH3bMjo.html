  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest take on Matchday 6:

•   <strong>Spain 1-2 England:</strong> Spain, still living off their past glory. England, somehow managed to win despite their best efforts to bottle it.
•   <strong>Netherlands 2-2 France:</strong> A draw? How boring. Neither team has the killer instinct to close out a game.
•   <strong>Portugal 1-0 Italy:</strong> Portugal shows Italy how the old guard is done. Italy is washed.
•   <strong>Germany 0-1 Belgium:</strong> Germany continues their downward spiral. Belgium wins, but does anyone really care?
•   <strong>Croatia 2-2 Denmark:</strong> Croatia and Denmark battled it out. Both teams showing they're content with mediocrity.
•   <strong>Austria 1-0 Switzerland:</strong> A thrilling match between two irrelevant teams. Austria barely won, Switzerland continues its descent into obscurity.
•   <strong>Ukraine 1-0 Sweden:</strong> A win for Ukraine. Sweden continues to be overrated.
•   <strong>Wales 0-2 Turkey:</strong> Wales continues to get cooked as they are a one man army. Turkey, a win against an awful opponent is barely a cause for celebration.</div>
