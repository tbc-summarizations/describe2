  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this done with brutal honesty, no sugarcoating. Here are my predictions:

•   <strong>Cyprus vs. San Marino 🇨🇾🇸🇲:</strong> Cyprus will crush San Marino. San Marino is basically a pub team that got lost on the way to a Sunday league match. Expect a scoreline of something like 5-0 or higher for Cyprus. They might even take pity on them by the end.

•   <strong>Andorra vs. Latvia 🇦🇩🇱🇻:</strong> This one's a snooze-fest. Both teams are pretty dire. I'll say Latvia ekes out a win, maybe 1-0 or 2-0, because Andorra is offensively challenged. Don't expect any excitement here.

•   <strong>England vs. Albania 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇦🇱:</strong> England will absolutely batter Albania. No contest here. England is far superior in every position. Expect a score like 4-0 or 5-1. The only hope Albania has is if England decides to just stroll through the game.

•   <strong>Malta vs. Finland 🇲🇹🇫🇮:</strong> Finland will win, but it won't be a blowout. They are a pretty ok team. Malta is better than some of these other smaller teams but they are still gonna lose with a score like 0-2 or 1-3.

•   <strong>Poland vs. Lithuania 🇵🇱🇱🇹:</strong> Poland should win comfortably. Lithuania are not a strong side at all, and Poland has some quality players. I'll go with 3-0 or 4-1 for Poland.

•   <strong>Romania vs. Bosnia 🇷🇴🇧🇦:</strong> This one is a bit more interesting, as Bosnia can be dangerous. But Romania at home should edge it. Expect a tight match, maybe 2-1 to Romania. Bosnia have the potential to surprise, though.

There you go. Straight to the point, no BS.</div>
