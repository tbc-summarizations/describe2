  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest prediction for those 2026 World Cup European Qualifiers, straight to the point:

<strong>Matchday 3</strong>

•   <strong>Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 vs. Liechtenstein 🇱🇮: 5-0.</strong> Wales needs to crush these small teams to build goal difference. No mercy.
•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰 vs. Belgium 🇧🇪: 1-3.</strong> North Macedonia will put up a fight at home but Belgium’s quality is far too superior. 
•   <strong>Gibraltar 🇬🇮 vs. Croatia 🇭🇷: 0-6.</strong> Embarrassing for Gibraltar. Croatia will treat this like a training session.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪 vs. Israel 🇮🇱: 0-2.</strong> A dull, tactical game. Israel is slightly better and takes it.
•   <strong>Norway 🇳🇴 vs. Italy 🇮🇹: 2-2.</strong> Haaland will score, but Italy has enough to scrape a draw. A tense match.
•   <strong>Czechia 🇨🇿 vs. Montenegro 🇲🇪: 2-0.</strong> Czechia has to take it to stay in contention.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦 vs. San Marino 🇸🇲: 7-0.</strong> San Marino is a joke. This will be a massacre.
•   <strong>Malta 🇲🇹 vs. Lithuania 🇱🇹: 1-1.</strong> Two terrible teams playing each other to a boring draw.
•   <strong>Andorra 🇦🇩 vs. England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿: 0-8.</strong> England runs riot against a bunch of amateurs. A complete mismatch.
•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹 vs. Romania 🇷🇴: 2-1.</strong> Austria is on the up, Romania is just average.
•   <strong>Finland 🇫🇮 vs. Netherlands 🇳🇱: 1-3.</strong> Netherlands will outclass them, even if Finland shows spirit.
•   <strong>Albania 🇦🇱 vs. Serbia 🇷🇸: 1-0.</strong> A heated, awful match. Albania wins through grit.

<strong>Matchday 4</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 vs. North Macedonia 🇲🇰: 1-1.</strong> Another boring draw, neither team is going anywhere.
•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 vs. Moldova 🇲🇩: 4-0.</strong> Italy needs to bounce back after Norway, Moldova is an easy target.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪 vs. Norway 🇳🇴: 0-3.</strong> Haaland will punish them. Norway wants to reach the world cup.
•   <strong>Croatia 🇭🇷 vs. Czechia 🇨🇿: 1-0.</strong> A tight, frustrating match. Croatia will find a way to win in the end.
•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 vs. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿: 2-0.</strong> Belgium is too strong. Wales won’t cope.
•   <strong>Faroe Islands 🇫🇴 vs. Gibraltar 🇬🇮: 2-0.</strong> A battle of the small teams. The Faroe Islands are slightly better.
•   <strong>Finland 🇫🇮 vs. Poland 🇵🇱: 1-2.</strong> A crucial match. Poland edges it.
•   <strong>San Marino 🇸🇲 vs. Austria 🇦🇹: 0-5.</strong> San Marino will get annihilated.
•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. Malta 🇲🇹: 6-0.</strong> Another humiliation for Malta.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 vs. Andorra 🇦🇩: 4-0.</strong> Serbia needs to win big to rebuild confidence after the Albania mess.
•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴 vs. Cyprus 🇨🇾: 2-0.</strong> Romania must win this to keep the dream alive.
•   <strong>Latvia 🇱🇻 vs. Albania 🇦🇱: 0-1.</strong> Another ugly game. Albania will grind out a win.

There it is, raw and to the point. Don’t expect miracles from these matches, some teams are just plain awful!</div>
