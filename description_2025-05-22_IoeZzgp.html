  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this "XI" with brutal honesty:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Gregor Kobel (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­):</strong> 7.5 - Solid keeper, but prone to errors sometimes. A good shot-stopper but has questionable decision-making in distribution.

â€¢   <strong>Aleksandr Silyanov (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 3 - Barely a professional-level player. Lacks tactical awareness and is physically weak.

â€¢   <strong>Manuel Akanji (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­):</strong> 7 - Decent defender, but sometimes caught out of position. Prone to individual errors under pressure.

â€¢   <strong>Kevin Mbabu (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­):</strong> 6 - Overrated. Offers little going forward and isn't reliable defensively.

â€¢   <strong>Igor Diveyev (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 4 - Average at best. Slow, clumsy, and lacks composure. A liability in a high-pressure game.

â€¢   <strong>Steven Zuber (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­):</strong> 5 - Inconsistent. Can be okay at times, but doesn't influence the game enough. Not a starting-quality midfielder for a top team.

â€¢   <strong>Granit Xhaka (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­):</strong> 6.5 - Disciplined player, but has poor decision-making. Not very creative and is a liability in midfield.

â€¢   <strong>Anton Miranchuk (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 5.5 - Decent technical skills, but lacks the physical presence to compete at a high level.

â€¢   <strong>Ivan Oblyakov (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 4 - Not very creative. Makes poor decisions on and off the ball.

â€¢   <strong>Zeki Amdouni (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­):</strong> 6 - Lacks composure. Is often out-muscled and struggles against physical defenders.

â€¢   <strong>Artem Dzyuba (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º):</strong> 3 - Past his prime, immobile, and offers little other than his height. A relic of a bygone era.

<strong>Team Rating (out of 10):</strong>

<strong>3.5</strong> - This team is a disaster. The defense is weak, the midfield lacks creativity, and the attack is toothless. They would struggle to compete against any serious team, regardless of tactics. Their lack of pace and technical ability would make them easy to exploit. This XI is a recipe for a humiliating defeat.</div>
