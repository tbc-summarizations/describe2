  <h1>Description for very_true.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a starter pack meme about "discord girls", these "girls" are most likely very young and most likely catfish. They don't have female friends in real life because they are obsessed with boys to the point of making it their whole personality. They are interested in things that are typically for boys so they can bond over it. They are always online on mobile, very unfunny, they have a "fucked up" past to gain sympathy, are extremely eccentric and use "she/her pronouns so that every boy will have to know". Overall, this is very negative and true stereotype.</div>
