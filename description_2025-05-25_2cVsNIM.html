  <h1>Description for 1024px-Wolverhampton_Wanderers_FC_crest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this Wolves squad apart, piece by piece:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Vitor Pereira (🇵🇹):</strong> 3/10. Let's be honest, Pereira's track record screams "mid-table mediocrity at best". He's bounced around enough clubs to make you dizzy, and his tactical style is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Wolves deserve better than a manager who seems content to settle for "just okay."

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Daniel Bentley (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 4/10. A backup keeper who's unlikely to ever be more than that. Safe hands, but nothing special.
•   <strong>Sam Johnstone (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Solid Premier League keeper, but not a game-changer. Reliable but has his limitations.
•   <strong>Jose Sa (🇵🇹):</strong> 7/10. One of the few bright spots. Good shot-stopper, decent distribution. A worthwhile keeper.
•   <strong>Tom King (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿):</strong> 2/10. Another backup. Likely won't get a sniff of first-team action unless there's a complete crisis.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Pedro Lima (🇧🇷):</strong> 5/10. Unproven youngster, could be decent but it’s a lottery ticket.
•   <strong>Craig Dawson (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 6/10. Veteran presence, good in the air, but his lack of pace is becoming a serious liability.
•   <strong>Matt Doherty (🇮🇪):</strong> 5/10. Once a decent wing-back, now just average and declining. Not going to provide much in attack or defense.
•   <strong>Santiago Bueno (🇺🇾):</strong> 5/10. Another youngster with potential but the jury is still out.
•   <strong>Toti Gomes (🇵🇹):</strong> 6/10. Solid defender, but nothing special, isn’t going to be top tier.
•   <strong>Emmanuel Agbadou (🇨🇮):</strong> 4/10. Lack of pace makes him a risk.
•   <strong>Yerson Mosquera (🇨🇴):</strong> 4/10. Injury prone.
•   <strong>Nasser Djiga (🇧🇫):</strong> 3/10. Raw talent, but miles away from being Premier League ready.
•   <strong>Bastien Meupiyou (🇫🇷):</strong> 2/10. Probably will never make it.
•   <strong>Nelson Semedo (🇵🇹):</strong> 6/10. Can be good offensively, but prone to defensive lapses. Needs more consistency.
•   <strong>Rayan Ait Nouri (🇩🇿):</strong> 7/10. One of Wolves' better defenders. Good going forward, but can be caught out defensively.
•   <strong>Rodrigo Gomes (🇵🇹):</strong> 5/10. Promising youngster, another potential wildcard.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Thomas Doyle (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 4/10. Decent in possession, lacks the bite and creativity to make a real impact.
•   <strong>Joao Gomes (🇧🇷):</strong> 7/10. Tenacious, hard-working midfielder. One of the few players who consistently gives 100%.
•   <strong>Boubacar Traore (🇲🇱):</strong> 5/10. Has flashes of brilliance, but needs to show more consistency.
•   <strong>Andre (🇧🇷):</strong> 4/10. Average at best and might not be able to handle the pace.
•   <strong>Enso Gonzalez (🇵🇾):</strong> 2/10. Another prospect, looks like he won’t turn out very well.
•   <strong>Pablo Sarabia (🇪🇸):</strong> 6/10. A technically gifted player, but lacks the physicality and pace needed.
•   <strong>Jean-Ricner Bellegarde (🇭🇹):</strong> 5/10. Workhorse with limited technical ability.
•   <strong>Marshall Munetsi (🇿🇼):</strong> 4/10. A decent backup, lacks creativity.
•   <strong>Matheus Cunha (🇧🇷):</strong> 7/10. Talented, but inconsistent. Needs to add more goals to his game.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Hee-Chan Hwang (🇰🇷):</strong> 7/10. Provides great work rate and a decent goal threat.
•   <strong>Carlos Forbs (🇵🇹):</strong> 4/10. Has pace, but lacks the composure and finishing ability.
•   <strong>Mateus Mane (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 3/10. Probably not cut out for Premier League.
•   <strong>Goncalo Guedes (🇵🇹):</strong> 4/10. Massively underachieving for his potential.
•   <strong>Jørgen Strand Larsen (🇳🇴):</strong> 3/10. Lacks the physical presence and technical ability to succeed in the Premier League.
•   <strong>Sasa Kalajdzic (🇦🇹):</strong> 4/10. Injury-prone.
•   <strong>Leon Chiwome (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 2/10. Might not make it.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 5/10</strong>

This squad looks like a mishmash of decent players, aging veterans, and unproven youngsters. There's a serious lack of quality depth in key areas, and the overall balance of the team is questionable. Unless Pereira can pull off a tactical miracle, Wolves look destined for a season of struggle. I wouldn't bet on them finishing in the top half, and a relegation battle wouldn't be a total surprise.
