  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A <strong>MUTHA</strong>*IN' PIGEON TRYNA PULL OFF A LIL' WAYNE IMPERSONATION?!

Pruh, look at this fool, struttin' around like he owns the place. First off, that tiny-ass hat? What in the goddamn Dollar Store clearance bin did you find that at, bruh? It's sittin' on his head like a damn thimble. And that "gold" chain? More like "gold-plated" from a vending machine at a truck stop. ZUH, you think that's gonna make you look hard? You look like a feathery little joke, cuh.

And what the hell is up with the fries? Is that his throne? Did he raid McDonald's dumpster and decide to become the King of Trash? Omaguh. Bruh probably eats better than half the people in my family, grubbin' on them greasy-ass fries. Reminds me of this time I saw my cousin, Tyrone, at a family barbeque...

...He was elbow-deep in the potato salad, lookin' like he hadn't eaten in weeks. My auntie tried to snatch the bowl away, but Tyrone just let out this primal "GRUHHH" and kept shoveling it in his face. Looked just like this pigeon right here, except Tyrone didn't have a fake gold chain... mostly 'cause he'd pawned it for crack money.

Anyway, back to this feathered fiend. Look at the way he's perched up there like he's too good for everyone else. I bet he's the type to shit on your car and then fly away cackling like a damn hyena. What a disrespectful Luh, Kid. Should have a Goonin Session.

Seriously, though, who dresses a pigeon up like this? Some bored-ass teenager with too much time on their hands? Probably the same kind of kid who spray-paints their initials on bus stops and thinks they're "artistic." Look at that newspaper too, that newspaper looks like it has been pissed and shitted on multiple times over the weeks. OMAGUH.

I swear, I've seen crackheads with more style than this pigeon. At least they have the excuse of being high as a kite. This bird just looks like he's trying way too hard. And failing miserably.

Honestly, I'm surprised he hasn't been swooped up by a hawk or something. Guess even predators have standards. "Nah, bruh, I ain't touchin' that. He's got the cooties."

The audacity of this pigeon, I swear. Walking around like he's the goddamn boss. Needs to be locked up and have a good hard whooping.

In conclusion, this pigeon is a disgrace to all avian creatures and a walking (or flying) punchline. Someone needs to confiscate his hat, take away his fries, and give him a serious reality check. He's a pigeon, not a goddamn rap star. Get over yourself, birdbrain.</div>
