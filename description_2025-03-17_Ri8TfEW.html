  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up buttercup, because we're about to tear this list of albums a new one!

<strong>A Tribe Called Quest - The Low End Theory:</strong> Oh, "The Low End Theory," huh? More like the "Low Effort Title." Did they spend more time finding samples than coming up with a creative name? It's a classic, sure, but let's be real, it's the musical equivalent of dad jeans.

<strong>Björk - Homogenic/Vespertine:</strong> Björk, bless her heart, sounds like she's gargling marbles while fighting off a pack of feral cats. These albums are basically audio Rorschach tests. If you say you "get it," you're either lying or you peak interest in "avant-garde" just to show off.

<strong>Black Country, New Road - Ants From Up There:</strong> Oh look, another band with a pretentious name that probably peaked in their freshman year of college. "Ants From Up There"? Sounds like a rejected Pixar pitch. I bet their music videos are all artsy shots of sidewalks.

<strong>Black Sabbath - Paranoid:</strong> "Paranoid"? More like "Predictable." Every angsty teenager thinks they're so edgy for listening to Black Sabbath. Newsflash, grandpa did it first. And probably better.

<strong>Bob Dylan - Blonde on Blonde/Highway 61 Revisited:</strong> Bob Dylan? More like Bob <em>Dull</em>an! I can't decide what's worse, his voice or his harmonica playing. He sounds like a dying goat gargling gravel, a true artist. Also highway 61 revisited? Who cares? Was the first visit not enough?

<strong>Car Seat Headrest - Twin Fantasy (Face to Face):</strong> Car Seat Headrest? More like "Car Seat <em>Restless</em>." The singer probably wrote this in his mom's minivan, feeling oh so deep about his high school crush. "Face to Face"? Yeah, because hiding behind a screen is too mainstream.

<strong>Chico Buarque - Construção:</strong> Never heard of them. Next!

<strong>Cocteau Twins - Heaven or Las Vegas:</strong> Sounds like the kind of music you hear in a really pretentious indie film about a girl with blue hair who works at a record store. Also, heaven or las vegas? Pick a struggle!

<strong>Daft Punk - Discovery:</strong> Daft Punk is just robots for people who don't understand electronica. They're the musical equivalent of a shiny, expensive toaster.

<strong>Danny Brown - Atrocity Exhibition:</strong> Danny Brown, you sound like a goblin doing stand-up comedy at 3 AM. "Atrocity Exhibition"? It's more like an "Awkward Exhibition" of your vocal chords.

<strong>David Bowie - ★ [Blackstar]/Station to Station/Ziggy Stardust:</strong> Okay, I'll give you Bowie. But let's be honest, half of his allure was the outfits. "Blackstar"? More like "Black...Snore." He's basically the David Guetta of old people's music.

<strong>Death - Symbolic/The Sound of Perseverance:</strong> Death? More like "Death...to my ears!" Growling vocals? More like growling indigestion. I bet they're all just really constipated.

<strong>Death Grips - Exmilitary:</strong> Death Grips? Ex-talent, more like. This sounds like someone throwing a synthesizer down a flight of stairs.

<strong>Earl Sweatshirt - Solace:</strong> "Solace"? More like "So-Lame." He looks like he hasn't showered since Obama was in office.

<strong>Elliott Smith - Either/Or:</strong> Elliott Smith? More like Elliott <em>Whimper</em>. This music is so depressing, it makes The Smiths sound like a party anthem.

<strong>Fiona Apple - When the Pawn...:</strong> Fiona Apple? Sounds like she's having a mental breakdown on the piano. "When the Pawn..." More like "When the Therapist Bills Arrive..."

<strong>Fishmans - LONG SEASON:</strong> Long Season? More like Long...and Boring. Did they just record a jam session and call it an album?

<strong>Frank Ocean - Blonde:</strong> Frank Ocean is just an excuse for basic people to pretend they have taste. "Blonde"? More like "Bland."

<strong>Freddie Gibbs &amp; Madlib - Piñata:</strong> Freddie Gibbs and Madlib? Sounds like a buddy cop movie from the 80s. "Piñata"? I bet their music is full of surprises...mostly bad ones.

<strong>George Harrison - All Things Must Pass:</strong> George Harrison? More like George <em>Harri-Boring</em>. All Things Must Pass? Yeah, like my patience while listening to this.

<strong>Godspeed You Black Emperor! - F# A#∞/Lift Your Skinny Fists.../Slow Riot...:</strong> Oh god, more post-rock nonsense. "Godspeed You Black Emperor!" sounds like a pretentious philosophy student trying to be edgy. "Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven"? More like "Lift Your Pretensions to Obscurity."

<strong>Gustavo Cerati - Bocanada:</strong> Who? Next!

<strong>Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness:</strong> "Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness"? What is this, a motivational poster for nihilists? Sounds like the soundtrack to a really depressing indie game about social anxiety.

<strong>J Dilla - Donuts:</strong> J Dilla? More like J <em>Dull</em>a. I bet he spent more time naming his tracks than actually making them. Also, donuts? Are you trying to appeal to Homer Simpson?

<strong>Jeff Buckley - Grace:</strong> Jeff Buckley? More like Jeff <em>Buck-Weak</em>. He sounds like he's about to cry every single note. "Grace"? More like "Grief."

<strong>JID - The Forever Story:</strong> JID? More like JID...of garbage. "The Forever Story"? More like "The Forever Annoying Story."

<strong>Kanye West - Late Registration/My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy/The College Dropout:</strong> Kanye West? More like Kanye <em>Waste</em>. I'd rather listen to a broken record than his music. "Late Registration"? More like "Late Talent." "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"? More like "My Narcissistic, Overproduced Mess." And don't even get me started on "The College Dropout." He should have stayed in school.

<strong>Kate Bush - Hounds of Love:</strong> Kate Bush? Sounds like she's channeling a banshee. "Hounds of Love"? More like "Hounds of Annoyance."

<strong>Kendrick Lamar - good kid, m.A.A.d city/To Pimp a Butterfly:</strong> Kendrick Lamar? Okay, he's actually good. But let's be real, he's overrated. "good kid, m.A.A.d city"? More like "good kid, trying to be edgy." "To Pimp a Butterfly"? More like "To Pretend I Understand the Meaning of This Album."

<strong>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King/Red:</strong> King Crimson? Sounds like the soundtrack to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. "In the Court of the Crimson King"? More like "In the Court of the Boredom King." And "Red"? Yeah, from all the blood you're losing from cutting yourself on how edgy it is.

<strong>Michael Jackson - Thriller:</strong> Michael Jackson? Okay, I can't roast Michael. He's a legend. But "Thriller"? More like "Chiller" because it's kinda dated now.

"In a Silent Way"? More like "In a Silent Snore." But "Kind of Blue" is decent. He's the David Guetta of old people's music.
