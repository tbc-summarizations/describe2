  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal truth about Matchday 6, where dreams went to die and some teams continued to be a joke:

•   <strong>Girona 0 - Liverpool 1:</strong> Girona, trying to play with the big boys, and failing miserably. Liverpool just casually strolling into the next round.
•   <strong>Dinamo Zagreb 0 - Celtic 0:</strong> A match so boring, even the fans couldn't stay awake. Both teams should be ashamed.
•   <strong>Atalanta 2 - Real Madrid 3:</strong> Atalanta tried to punch above their weight, only to realize they're still just a mid-table team playing against a titan.
•   <strong>Bayer Leverkusen 1 - Inter Milan 0:</strong> Leverkusen, the Germans who occasionally remember they can play football. Inter, consistent in their inconsistency.
•   <strong>Club Brugge 2 - Sporting CP 1:</strong> A mediocre match between two teams that no one outside of Belgium and Portugal cares about.
•   <strong>Red Bull Salzburg 0 - Paris Saint-Germain 3:</strong> Salzburg got a reality check. PSG showing them the difference between a toy bull and a real one.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk 1 - Bayern Munich 5:</strong> Shakhtar, bravely facing the Bavarian machine, only to get dismantled piece by piece.
•   <strong>RB Leipzig 2 - Aston Villa 3:</strong> Leipzig proving they're the second-rate Red Bull team. Aston Villa, showing that even a city known for cars can score goals.
•   <strong>Brest 1 - PSV Eindhoven 0:</strong> Brest defeating PSV in the most lackluster way possible
•   <strong>Atlético Madrid 3 - Slovan Bratislava 1:</strong> Atlético, proving that they're still relevant, at least against teams from Slovakia.
•   <strong>Lille 3 - Sturm Graz 2:</strong> Lille somehow snatching a victory from Sturm Graz
•   <strong>Milan 2 - Red Star Belgrade 1:</strong> Milan, barely scraping by against Red Star, proving that their glory days are long gone.
•   <strong>Arsenal 3 - Monaco 0:</strong> Arsenal, finally showing some competence. Monaco, proving they're just a feeder club for bigger teams.
•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund 2 - Barcelona 3:</strong> Dortmund, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Barcelona, continuing to be a shadow of their former selves, but still winning.
•   <strong>Feyenoord 4 - Sparta Prague 2:</strong> Feyenoord, not as bad as expected. Sparta Prague, exactly as bad as expected.
•   <strong>Juventus 2 - Manchester City 0:</strong> Juventus defeating Manchester City
•   <strong>Benfica 0 - Bologna 0:</strong> A boring match that proves both teams have nothing to do in this UCL phase
•   <strong>VfB Stuttgart 5 - Young Boys 1:</strong> Stuttgart demolishing Young Boys, what a beatdown.</div>
