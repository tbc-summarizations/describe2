  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest prediction for the 2024-25 UEFA Conference League Final between Real Betis and Chelsea, given the squads you provided:

<strong>Real Betis's Chances: Bleak.</strong>

Let's be frank, Real Betis is punching way above their weight to even be in the final with this squad. Manuel Pellegrini is a decent manager, but he's not a miracle worker.

•   <strong>Defense:</strong> Adrian is past his prime and a liability. The backline of Rodriguez, Natan, Bartra, and Sabaly is average at best, and will likely be torn apart by Chelsea's pace and creativity.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> Fornals and Cardoso are hardworking, but lack the quality to control the midfield against Chelsea's superior players.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> Ezzalzouli is inconsistent. Isco, while talented, is getting older and lacks the stamina for a full 90 minutes at this level. Bakambu? A journeyman striker who will struggle against a Premier League defense.
•   <strong>Substitutes:</strong> The Betis bench is filled with youth players and journeymen. They won't offer much of an impact.

<strong>Chelsea's Chances: High, but with caveats.</strong>

Chelsea should win this comfortably, but they are still Chelsea, which means they have a penchant for self-destruction.

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Jorgensen is a decent keeper.
•   <strong>Defense:</strong> Cucurella and Badiashile have moments of brilliance and moments of complete brain-farts. Chalobah is solid but unspectacular. Gusto is a good young player.
•   <strong>Midfield:</strong> Caicedo is a workhorse, but sometimes lacks positional discipline. Palmer and Enzo Fernandez are the creative hub, but can go missing in big games. Neto offers pace and trickery, but is often wasteful.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> Nicolas Jackson is frustratingly inconsistent. He'll either score a hat-trick or miss every chance he gets.
•   <strong>Substitutes:</strong> The Chelsea bench has game-changers like Nkunku and Sancho (if he finds his form). James and Colwill offer quality defensive options.

<strong>Prediction:</strong>

<strong>Chelsea 4 - 1 Real Betis</strong>

Chelsea's superior squad depth and individual quality will be too much for Real Betis to handle. Betis might score a consolation goal, but they will ultimately be outclassed.

<strong>Key Factors:</strong>

•   <strong>Chelsea's attack needs to be clinical:</strong> If Jackson has one of his off days, the game could be closer.
•   <strong>Betis needs a miracle performance from Isco:</strong> If Isco can pull the strings and create chances, Betis might stand a chance.
•   <strong>Chelsea's mentality:</strong> If Chelsea take Betis lightly, they could be in for a surprise.

In short: Chelsea should win this, and win it easily. Real Betis is just not good enough to compete with a team of Chelsea's caliber.</div>
