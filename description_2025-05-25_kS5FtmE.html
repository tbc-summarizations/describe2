  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. This is going to be a bloodbath.

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Ruud van Nistelrooy (Coach):</strong> 6/10. Has potential, a proven goalscorer but his coaching record needs work. Questionable appointment but has a chance to prove himself.

•   <strong>Danny Ward:</strong> 3/10. Absolute liability. Can't command a box, prone to errors. Championship level at best.

•   <strong>Daniel Iversen:</strong> 4/10. Slightly better than Ward, but still unconvincing. Not a long-term solution.

•   <strong>Mads Hermansen:</strong> 7/10. Promising, good distribution. Could be a decent signing, but needs to prove himself.

•   <strong>Jakub Stolarczyk:</strong> N/A. Don't know enough about him.

•   <strong>Ricardo Pereira:</strong> 7/10. When fit, a quality player. Question is, how often is he fit?

•   <strong>James Justin:</strong> 6/10. Decent full-back, but injury-prone and lacks consistency.

•   <strong>Woyo Coulibaly:</strong> N/A. Unknown quantity.

•   <strong>Jannik Vestergaard:</strong> 2/10. Slow, clumsy, and a walking disaster waiting to happen. Get rid.

•   <strong>Conor Coady:</strong> 5/10. A decent squad player. Championship level and nothing more.

•   <strong>Harry Souttar:</strong> 5/10. Slow, not very agile and not a great passer, also injury prone. Can be useful in the Championship.

•   <strong>Wout Faes:</strong> 6/10. Passionate. Can be an okay Championship CB.

•   <strong>Memeh Caleb Okoli:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Luke Thomas:</strong> 5/10. Okay.

•   <strong>Victor Kristiansen:</strong> 6/10. Unspectacular but solid.

•   <strong>Harry Winks:</strong> 6/10. Decent passer, but lacks physicality and doesn't offer much defensively. Okay.

•   <strong>Wilfred Ndidi:</strong> 6/10. Used to be great, but has lost his bite. Can be serviceable in the Championship.

•   <strong>Oliver Skipp:</strong> 6/10. Decent midfielder, but his passing range is very limited. Not good enough for the Premier League, good enough for Championship.

•   <strong>Boubakary Soumare:</strong> 5/10. Lazy, inconsistent. Not good.

•   <strong>Sammy Braybrooke:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Bilal El Khannouss:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Michael Golding:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Jordan Ayew:</strong> 7/10. Great dribbler and passer, not a fantastic finisher.

•   <strong>Kasey McAteer:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Abdul Fatawu:</strong> 7/10. Great potential, just needs the right coaching.

•   <strong>Facundo Buonanotte:</strong> 7/10. Good potential and an overall good player.

•   <strong>Jeremy Monga:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Bobby Reid:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Stephy Mavididi:</strong> 6/10. Can beat a man. Championship level.

•   <strong>Jake Evans:</strong> N/A. Unknown.

•   <strong>Jamie Vardy:</strong> 7/10. A legend, but past his prime. Still has goals in him, but can't rely on him week in, week out.

•   <strong>Odsonne Eduoard:</strong> 6/10. Flashes of brilliance but inconsistent. Can score goals in the Championship.

•   <strong>Patson Daka:</strong> 5/10. Misses too many chances.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

<strong>5.5/10.</strong> This squad is a mess. There's a mix of players who are past their prime, not good enough, or completely unproven. They will probably get promoted to the Premier League, but they will get relegated right away. A lot of deadwood needs to be cleared out, and some serious investment is needed to compete in the Premier League again.</div>
