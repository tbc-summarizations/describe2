  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I rank those potential Battle For Nitrous debutants, from least to most deserving, in my brutally honest opinion:

20. <strong>Toilet</strong>: Seriously? This is the type of filler character that ruins competition shows. Hard pass.

19. <strong>Porkchop</strong>: Unless there's some deep lore I'm missing, it's a bland concept. Instantly forgettable.

18. <strong>Afghanistan</strong>: Way too sensitive for a contest like this. It also doesn't have enough character appeal to make it work.

17. <strong>Parlo Thumbnail</strong>: Just... no. A thumbnail? That's your idea for a contestant? Lazy and uninspired.

16. <strong>Coke Vanilla</strong>: Pass. A flavor of soda is stupid as a contender.

15. <strong>Tierlisty</strong>: Ugh, so meta and self-referential. It'll get old <em>fast</em>.

14. <strong>Garbage Human</strong>: Edgy for the sake of being edgy. It'd quickly become annoying.

13. <strong>Lil B</strong>: Extremely hit or miss and is more likely to be a miss.

12. <strong>Strawberry Meeth</strong>: It's bizarre but I don't think it has the right appeal or character.

11. <strong>GD King Von</strong>: I don't like the concept of basing a contestant off of a person.

10. <strong>Pulse Demon</strong>: I think it has potential to be like a comedic character, but i don't think the character would hold it's value up in a long run.

9. <strong>Saturn</strong>: I think it would be boring to watch most times, and I don't really care if it ever debuts.

8. <strong>White Hole</strong>: Might be visually interesting, but I just don't see the personality.

7. <strong>M-16</strong>: Only slightly better than Hydrogen Bomb because at least it could have some design flexibility.

6. <strong>Hydrogen Bomb</strong>: It's too heavy and serious for Battle For Nitrous.

5. <strong>Hyperlaser Gun</strong>: A bit generic, but the design possibilities are cool and it could have a fun, over-the-top personality.

4. <strong>YXuvg( U[iZ}v3.w !]$PTy OWS(&gt; L~^q8t</strong>: The sheer randomness could be hilarious. A wildcard pick that might actually pay off.

3. <strong>GMDCarti</strong>: GMDCarti can be a good contestant if the creators know what they're doing, but it does leave for a risk it being bland.

2. <strong>Kai Cenat</strong>: Annoying and popular, which makes for a fun character dynamic.

1. <strong>Black Circle</strong>: This has some great opportunities for lore, comedy, and overall great characteristics, which allows the contestant to do well.</div>
