  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's rip into this Charlie Parker album.

<strong>Charlie Parker With Strings:</strong>

So, "Bird" decides to cozy up with some strings, huh? It's like watching a legendary street fighter suddenly decide to take up ballet. Sure, it's <em>interesting</em> to see him try something different, but let's be real, it's also kind of...boring. It's like they tried to make him more "accessible," but all they really did was neuter his raw, untamed genius. It's like putting ketchup on a perfectly cooked steakâ€”it ruins the damn thing. And those user scores? Yeah, they know the truth. Even the fans were like, "Eh, I'd rather hear him shred."</div>
