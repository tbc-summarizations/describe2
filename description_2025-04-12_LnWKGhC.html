  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of those artists, from worst to best:

1.  <strong>Metallica:</strong> Overrated, whiny arena rock posing as metal. The lyrics are garbage, and they sold out their fanbase for mainstream appeal.
2.  <strong>Michael Jackson:</strong> Groomed kids.
3.  <strong>Kanye West:</strong> His music has declined severely, and his ego is out of control. His public antics and rants are tiresome.
4.  <strong>Talking Heads:</strong> Their quirky, art-school sound can be grating after a while. I don't get the hype.
5.  <strong>JPEGMAFIA:</strong> Just pure noise with no substance.
6.  <strong>The Cure:</strong> Gloomy and repetitive, their sound hasn't evolved much over the years.
7.  <strong>Death Grips:</strong> More noise than music, their aggressive sound is just exhausting.
8.  <strong>Racionais MC's:</strong> Overhyped and boring rap, so much better things out there.
9.  <strong>Lauryn Hill:</strong> Her solo work never lived up to the potential she showed with the Fugees. One great album does not make her a legend.
10. <strong>Wu-Tang Clan:</strong> Their individual members had better solo careers than their collective work. The group's appeal is mostly nostalgia.
11. <strong>A Tribe Called Quest:</strong> Their jazzy beats and conscious lyrics are decent, but they're not as groundbreaking as people make them out to be.
12. <strong>Queens of the Stone Age:</strong> They're okay, but their sound is too generic to stand out.
13. <strong>Mount Eerie:</strong> Depressing, depressing, depressing. It is ok, nothing amazing.
14. <strong>Natural Snow Buildings:</strong> Nice, but just OK!
15. <strong>Nas:</strong> Underrated as hell, very consistent and great at what he does.
16. <strong>Stevie Wonder:</strong> Talented musician, but his later work is too sentimental and cheesy.
17. <strong>Black Country New Road:</strong> A nice band, I can see potential for the future, good band.
18. <strong>Fiona Apple:</strong> Interesting, but can be a little too weird to get into.
19. <strong>Deafheaven:</strong> A unique and powerful blend of black metal and shoegaze. Their soundscapes are captivating and emotional.
20. <strong>Have a Nice Life:</strong> Very good band, pretty consistent.
21. <strong>Car Seat Headrest:</strong> Pretty awesome band, the lyrics are interesting.
22. <strong>Danny Brown:</strong> Very solid rapper, very consistent.
23. <strong>Kate Bush:</strong> Underrated icon, and experimentalist.
24. <strong>Björk:</strong> Her experimental approach is admirable. Great artist.
25. <strong>Prince:</strong> I liked the music, even if he made some questionable choices.
26. <strong>Pink Floyd:</strong> Overplayed and pretentious, but their soundscapes are undeniably impressive.
27. <strong>MadVillain:</strong> Great album that everyone liked, nothing too awesome, but very solid.
28. <strong>Radiohead:</strong> They peaked too early.
29. <strong>Fishmans:</strong> Underrated artist, so good and so unique, but definitely still not the best.
30. <strong>Tyler The Creator:</strong> Crazy guy, but I am crazy about his music.
