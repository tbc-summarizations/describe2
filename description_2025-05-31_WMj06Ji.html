  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I see these matches going down. Buckle up, because I'm not holding back:

<strong>3W 1L (The winner will advance to the knockout round)</strong>

•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 vs. Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> This is a clash of styles, but frankly, Turkey is the underdog here. They lack the tactical discipline of the Dutch. I predict a 3-1 victory for Netherlands, with Turkey's single goal a consolation prize.

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 vs. Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> France's midfield is just too dominant. Portugal will rely on moments of brilliance from Ronaldo, but it won't be enough. A convincing 4-1 win for France.

•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 vs. Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> The Swiss will try to bore Italy into submission, but the Italians are too savvy. A tight, tactical affair, but Italy will edge it 2-1 with a late goal.

•   <strong>Hungary 🇭🇺 vs. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Wales has seen better days. Their midfield is aging, and Hungary's counter-attacking football will punish them. A 2-0 win for Hungary, sending Wales crashing out.

<strong>1W 3L (The loser will be eliminated)</strong>

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱 vs. Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> Poland has the individual quality, but Scotland's grit and determination will see them through. A scrappy 1-0 win for Scotland.

•   <strong>Albania 🇦🇱 vs. Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> A dire match between two underwhelming sides. Norway's Haaland needs service to score, and Albania's defense will frustrate them. A boring 0-0 draw, decided on penalties with Albania losing.

•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪 vs. Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> Georgia's passion will be no match for Greece's tactical prowess. A professional 2-0 win for Greece, sending Georgia home disappointed.

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 vs. Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> A heated Balkan derby with more off-field drama than on-field quality. Serbia's firepower is the deciding factor. They should win 3-1.</div>
