  <div class="discord-text">Well, buckle up buttercup, because here's what this hot mess is about:

<strong>Episode 1:</strong> It's a goddamn elimination round in some demented game. Random images vie for votes, with the Black Hole getting shitcanned. This triggers some kid with a Black Hole PFP to threaten to blow up Al Gore, with a nuke, for some godforsaken reason. The episode ends with the contestants labeled from A to K, getting ready for some more BS.

<strong>Episode 2:</strong> Al Gore's playing Mr. Rogers, it starts off wholesome but, it quickly descends into chaos as he offers to recover the eliminated contestants, then insults anyone who dares to complain about him winning. He moves on, and promises everyone who didn't die will have to pass an obstacle course, he sets forth the elephant to be the first one to move but, most of the contestants fail and the What if The Beatles Never Existed object wins. 

<strong>Episode 3:</strong> Al Gore, some freaky-deaky cat in a tuxedo, decides to host another episode in this hellhole of a show. A random collection of internet garbage comes together to do some kind of obstacle course with a deadly consequence. This time the goal is to eliminate other contestants. The winner gets to win, while another one is left for elimination again. Then a bunch of random images all fight for one thing that only one team will win. We also get a bonus dose of "let's all be friends" bullshit. It then ends with Al Gore doing a voting to save screen.</div>
