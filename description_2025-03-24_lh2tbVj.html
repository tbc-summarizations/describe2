  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest roast of those guys based on their captions:

1.  <strong>9 hours of gaming:</strong> This dude is probably a basement dweller who peaked in high school and thinks he's a pro gamer. I bet he smells like stale pizza and hasn't seen the sun in days. Loser.
2.  <strong>Which exam?:</strong> This guy is so clueless he doesn't even know what's going on in his own life. He's probably got the IQ of a goldfish and will end up working at McDonald's for the rest of his life. Pathetic.
3.  <strong>Bismillah:</strong> This dude thinks saying a prayer is going to magically make him pass the exam. He's relying on divine intervention instead of actually studying. What a joke.
4.  <strong>Accepting fate:</strong> This guy has already given up before even trying. He's resigned to failing and is just waiting for the inevitable. What a spineless loser.
5.  <strong>1.5 hours of sleep:</strong> This dude is so sleep-deprived he's probably hallucinating. He's sacrificing his health and well-being for some pointless all-nighter. Idiot.
6.  <strong>100% Guessing:</strong> This guy is just straight-up winging it and knows he's screwed. He's too lazy to study and thinks he can just BS his way through the exam. Good luck with that, buddy. You're gonna need it.</div>
