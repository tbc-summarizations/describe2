  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's break down this cursed Garfield image.

<strong>Meaning &amp; Message:</strong> The image is playing on the idea of a highly improbable and disturbing romantic pairing: Garfield, the lazy, lasagna-loving cat, with some kind of dark, possibly cosmic, female figure. The "Garfield x ??????" implies a crack pairing taken to an extreme, something so wrong it's both funny and unsettling. The text "Never together: because some romances are just too cursed..." emphasizes the unsuitability of the relationship. The "hit the gym" comment adds a layer of absurd humor by suggesting Garfield is trying to be appealing. The overall message is a dark, sarcastic joke about forbidden or incompatible relationships, pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable.

<strong>Inspiration:</strong> The image likely draws inspiration from:

•   <strong>Crack pairings/fanfiction:</strong> The internet's fascination with bizarre romantic pairings.
•   <strong>Creepypasta Garfield:</strong> The trend of depicting Garfield as a monstrous, eldritch horror.
•   <strong>Internet humor/memes:</strong> A general tendency towards edgy and surreal content.

<strong>Kanye Album Cover?</strong> Absolutely, without a doubt. This is something Kanye would absolutely put as an album cover unironically. Here's why:

•   <strong>Provocative and controversial:</strong> Kanye thrives on generating discussion and pushing boundaries. The absurdity of the image would definitely achieve that.
•   <strong>"Deep" symbolic interpretation:</strong> He would find some deeper symbolic meaning in this. Kanye loves finding meaning in the mundane.
•   <strong>Visually striking:</strong> Despite being disturbing, the image has a certain visual impact.
•   <strong>General weirdness:</strong> Kanye has shown a penchant for strange and unsettling imagery, so this image would fit right in with his aesthetics. He loves to be seen as artistic in every way so he would definitely use this.
• <strong>Contradictory to Kanye's religious beliefs</strong>: The dark, satanic presence next to Garfield is probably something Kanye will never publicly admit that he has an infatuation with. It goes against his modern self image.

Overall, this image is a darkly comedic piece of internet art that taps into several online trends.</div>
