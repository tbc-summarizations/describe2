AtlÃ©tico Madrid ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

AS Saint-Ã‰tienne ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Alright, here's a brutally honest take on how each group will play out, no sugarcoating:

â€¢   <strong>Group A:</strong> Arsenal will dominate this group, no question. They're a far superior team. AVS is a decent side, but they won't challenge Arsenal. Dynamo Kyiv is a wildcard due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, but their quality is below Arsenal and AVS. Austria Klagenfurt is just making up the numbers. Arsenal and AVS advance.

â€¢   <strong>Group B:</strong> Ajax will comfortably win this group, they are still a good team even with all that has happened to them in recent years. Heidenheim has little to no chance. Alanyaspor and Cracovia are average at best. Ajax will go through easily.

â€¢   <strong>Group C:</strong> Bayer Leverkusen will advance but they are not good enough to win UCL at this moment. Anderlecht might give Leverkusen a good run as they are a decent club, but they don't have the strength to reach top 8. Beerschot and Banik Ostrava is in UEFA's competition for entertainment as they are not good enough.

â€¢   <strong>Group D:</strong> Bologna is a good team. Austria Wien is below average and they will have an impossible job stopping Bologna. Angers is another wildcard as France are in deep crisis at the moment and it's going to be a chaotic season for Angers. Grasshoppers is one of the worst team on this list, they are really really bad. Bologna and Angers advance.

â€¢   <strong>Group E:</strong> Atalanta are in crisis after losing Gasperini as their coach, but they are still the most dominant in this group and I don't see them having any trouble. AEK Athens is a decent club but they lack top level players, they still manage to get the second spot easily though. GKS Katowice and Adana Demirspor will cause problems but they aren't good enough.

â€¢   <strong>Group F:</strong> Bournemouth is just one of the worst clubs I've ever seen. Arouca isn't that good either. Basel are a decent side and will secure first place and it won't even be that hard. Chornomorets Odesa can't do anything. Basel advance.

â€¢   <strong>Group G:</strong> Athletic Bilbao is a powerhouse, and Celtic is not good enough. Celtic will not advance and I don't see them putting up a fight. Almere City and Aberdeen have no chance. Bilbao is going to dominate.

â€¢   <strong>Group H:</strong> Atletico Madrid are by far the best team in this group. Aris are decent and 1. FC Slovacko are pretty good. But it's not enough to put up a fight against Atletico. AS Saint-Etienne are a really bad club, they shouldn't even be here. Atletico and Aris advance.</div>
