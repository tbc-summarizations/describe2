  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this hot mess of a video.

First off, the pigeon: Look at this pitiful excuse for a bird. It's the kind of pigeon that gets bullied by sparrows. I bet its only skill is leaving sad little poops on statues. It's the type of bird that people look at and think, "Wow, nature really screwed up on that one." Also, what in the goddamn purple is that coloration? It looks like someone tried to dye it as a joke. Did it get dipped in a vat of grape soda? If that bird wasnâ€™t dumb enough already, it just had to come out with the most generic backstory that is somehow filled with cliches.

Then we have the trash can. The pigeon thinks its place is in the trash can while standing on top of the skull? Okay, so you are a living trash can. I'm not even going to waste any jokes on this low-hanging fruit of a metaphor, it's pretty self explanatory.

Next, the skull: Oh, how ironic, It must be so tired of getting dragged along everywhere because there is no life left. Now, it's just a dusty reminder that everything, even the most dramatic pigeon, eventually ends up as bone dust.

Clown emojis: Ah yes, a beautiful aesthetic. I guess you are calling everyone a clown for just laughing at the fact of how meaningless this whole ordeal is. I bet you also like the taste of pennies.

The text "OK BUT WHO FUCKING CARES": It's an existential crisis wrapped in a meme. It's the kind of thing you see plastered on the notebooks of emo teenagers who think they've discovered the meaning of life (which is, apparently, that nobody cares).

The audio: Ah yes, the whiny voice that thinks its life is the hardest in the world when in reality there is nothing special about it at all. Sure, you had cancer and some dog attacks, big woop, get a job and stop whining.

Overall, this video is a tragedy. A masterpiece of cringe that makes me want to question every decision I've ever made in my life. Keep crying kiddo, get off the internet.</div>
