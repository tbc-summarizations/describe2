  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Well, well, well, look what we have here â€“ a Balkan Cup final that was less a display of skill and more a testament to mediocrity. Croatia, with their checkered pride barely intact, managed to scrape by with a 2-0 victory over a Montenegro side that apparently forgot they were supposed to be playing football.

Let's be honest, Croatia's win was about as exciting as watching paint dry. Two goals from Marko Pjaca in extra time? Give me a break. It took them over 90 minutes to figure out how to score against a team that probably couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. And let's not pretend Croatia's "domination" was anything to write home about. Sure, they had more shots, but most of them were probably prayers launched into the stands.

As for Montenegro, where do I even begin? You call that a football team? They had fewer shots, fewer shots on target, and somehow managed to make even passing look like a monumental challenge. A whole 3 shots on target? That's not even trying. They ran a bit less, and had possession less. They should just stick to whatever it is Montenegrans are good at, because it sure as hell isn't football.

In summary, this match was a monumental waste of everyone's time. Both teams should be ashamed of their performance. I've seen more exciting games at a retirement home. What a joke.</div>
