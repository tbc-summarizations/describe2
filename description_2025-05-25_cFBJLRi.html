  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get brutally honest about this list of "best songs":

<strong>General Impressions:</strong>

•   <strong>Heavy U.S. Bias:</strong> Dude, it's glaring. You clearly have a preference, which is fine, but it undermines any claim of objectivity.
•   <strong>Genre Hopping:</strong> The variety is chaotic. You jump from metal to classical to hip hop within a few years. It suggests more of a personal playlist than a curated "best of" list.
•   <strong>Obscurity Factor:</strong> Some of these picks are DEEP cuts. You're not catering to a mainstream audience here, which is fine if that's your intent, but it limits the list's general appeal.

<strong>Specifics:</strong>

•   <strong>2000: Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Sleep:</strong> A good start. A genuinely influential and atmospheric piece. I appreciate the inclusion.
•   <strong>2001: System of a Down - Chop Suey!:</strong> Massively overrated. A fun, energetic song, sure, but "best of the year?" I highly disagree. Nu-metal at its most cartoonish.
•   <strong>2002: Myslovitz - Chciałbym umrzeć z miłości:</strong> Okay, the language barrier makes this hard to judge fairly, but "Slowcore" from Poland doesn't exactly scream "best song."
•   <strong>2003: OutKast - Hey Ya!:</strong> Agreed. One of the most iconic and innovative pop songs of the decade.
•   <strong>2004: Max Richter - On the Nature of Daylight:</strong> Solid choice. A genuinely beautiful and emotionally resonant piece.
•   <strong>2005: The Decemberists - The Mariner's Revenge Song:</strong> Way too theatrical for its own good. Overlong and ultimately grating.
•   <strong>2006: 目黒将司 [Shoji Meguro] - キミの記憶:</strong> Purely based on nostalgia.
•   <strong>2007: Alter Bridge - Blackbird:</strong> Generic post-grunge. Perfectly acceptable for what it is, but it has no business being on a "best of" list.
•   <strong>2008: Have a Nice Life - Earthmover:</strong> Atmospheric but ultimately tedious. A bit too "try hard" in its bleakness.
•   <strong>2009: Between the Buried and Me - Swim To The Moon:</strong> Technical wankery masquerading as songwriting. Self-indulgent and exhausting.
•   <strong>2010: Canserbero - ¿Y la felicidad qué?:</strong> A solid choice.
•   <strong>2011: The Flaming Lips - 7 Skies H3:</strong> Too long and unfocused.
•   <strong>2012: Kendrick Lamar - Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst:</strong> Great pick. A deeply introspective and powerful piece of hip hop.
•   <strong>2013: Ace Hood - Bugatti:</strong> Annoying as hell. A total waste of sound.
•   <strong>2014: LCD Soundsystem - All My Friends:</strong> Absolutely. A modern classic.
•   <strong>2015: Death Grips - On GP:</strong> Challenging and abrasive, but also undeniably compelling.
•   <strong>2016: Danny Brown - Ain't It Funny:</strong> A bit too experimental for its own good, but I appreciate the ambition.
•   <strong>2017: Tee Lopes - Lights, Camera, Action! (Studiopolis Act 1):</strong> Purely based on nostalgia.
•   <strong>2018: André 3000 - Me&amp;My (To Bury Your Parents):</strong> A genuinely beautiful and emotionally resonant piece.
•   <strong>2019: Weyes Blood - Andromeda:</strong> A solid choice.
•   <strong>2020: Mac Miller - Good News:</strong> A great choice. A genuinely beautiful and emotionally resonant piece.
•   <strong>2021: Sam Gellaitry - Assumptions:</strong> A bit too generic for its own good, I appreciate the ambition.
•   <strong>2022: JID - 2007:</strong> A very solid choice.
•   <strong>2023: Willy Rodriguez - wetdream:</strong> The music is too bland and uninspired, I would disagree.
•   <strong>2024: Geordie Greep - Holy, Holy:</strong> Tedious and unoriginal. I would disagree.
•   <strong>2025: billy woods - A Doll Fulla Pins:</strong> A solid choice.

<strong>Overall:</strong>

Your list is a mess. It's inconsistent, biased, and often chooses "obscure" over "good." It's a reflection of YOUR personal taste, which is fine, but it's a terrible representation of what would be considered the "best" songs of each year. You need to broaden your horizons and be more critical in your selections.</div>
