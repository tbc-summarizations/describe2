  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's get brutally honest about this hypothetical Fulham vs. AZ Champions League final.

<strong>The Brutal Truth:</strong>

Fulham has virtually zero chance. Like, almost none. This isn't an even matchup.

•   <strong>Squad Depth:</strong> Fulham's squad is decent for the Premier League (sometimes), but it lacks the depth and top-tier talent required to consistently win against Europe's elite. AZ, while not a European powerhouse, has a well-balanced squad and a history of developing young talent. They lack depth, however.
•   <strong>Midfield Battle:</strong> Fulham's midfield of Cairney, Iwobi, and Pereira is okay, but lacks the grit and winning mentality to win. In addition, AZ's midfield is just better.
•   <strong>Attack:</strong> Raul Jimenez had his day, Rodrigo Muniz hasn't proven himself at the top level, and Willian is in his twilight years. AZ's attack, while not star-studded, are more likely to have more impact due to the midfielders.

<strong>The Prediction:</strong>

AZ will win 3-1.

Fulham will put up a fight for a brief period, but AZ's superior squad will take over. It won't be a complete embarrassment for Fulham, but they'll be outclassed. Let's be real, Fulham winning the Champions League is like Leicester City winning the Champions League – a fun idea that would be great for the neutral, but about as likely as finding a unicorn.</div>
