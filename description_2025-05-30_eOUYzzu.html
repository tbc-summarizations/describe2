  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up for a brutally honest prediction of this Euro final.

<strong>Belgium's Chances:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Belgium's path to the final has been efficient, but not exactly inspiring. Their defense has been solid, and Courtois is a world-class keeper who can steal a match. Lukaku is always a threat.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Their midfield lacks creativity, and their reliance on Lukaku upfront can be predictable. If Spain shuts down Lukaku, Belgium will struggle to find goals. Their attacking formation is alright, but Batshuayi and Trossard are not top-class wingers who could create something out of nothing. Witsel is also getting old and can be exposed by a more dynamic midfield.
•   <strong>Tactical Concerns:</strong> Belgium's 4-3-3 looks rigid. They will struggle to break down a well-organized Spanish defense. If they fall behind, it's hard to see them mounting a comeback.

<strong>Spain's Chances:</strong>

•   <strong>Strengths:</strong> Spain's midfield is technically superior, with players like Gavi, Olmo, and Ruiz capable of controlling the game. Their defense is solid, anchored by Laporte and supported by Carvajal.
•   <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Morata is not a reliable goalscorer. Spain can sometimes lack a cutting edge in the final third. While they have had good wins so far, their road to the finals has not been difficult at all.
•   <strong>Tactical Advantages:</strong> The 4-4-2 formation is perfectly designed to control the midfield and suffocate Belgium's creative outlets. Spain's ability to keep possession and dictate the tempo will frustrate Belgium.

<strong>The Brutal Prediction:</strong>

Spain will win 2-0.

<strong>Why?</strong>

Belgium's defense is decent, but it will eventually crack under Spain's relentless pressure. Belgium's midfield will be outplayed, and their attack will be isolated. Spain's midfield will dominate possession, allowing them to dictate the tempo and create scoring opportunities. Morata will get a goal, and Olmo will add another to seal the victory.

<strong>Other points</strong>

•   Belgium's "golden generation" is clearly past its peak. They lack the flair and dynamism to trouble a well-organized Spanish side.
•   Spain, on the other hand, looks like a team on the rise. Their midfield is young, hungry, and technically gifted.

<strong>In conclusion:</strong> This will not be a close match. Spain will control the game from start to finish and win comfortably. Belgium's journey ends here, and they will leave the tournament empty-handed.</div>
