  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest summary of this so-called "UCL Final," holding absolutely nothing back:

So, we've got Bayer Leverkusen, the team that thinks they're hot stuff, choking in a final once again. You had 61% possession and still needed a lucky goal from that scrub Martin Terrier? Pathetic. 14 total shots and only managed one measly goal? Your finishing is as tragic as your trophy cabinet. You ran more, but what good is distance covered when you're just running around like headless chickens?

And Sporting CP, don't think you're escaping the roast. You got outplayed, out-possessed, and yet somehow stumbled your way to a win. You relied on an early goal from Nuno Santos and some stoppage-time garbage from Gyokeres to bail you out. Your 4 total shots is just sad. Seriously, you played like you were scared shitless the entire match. This win was pure luck, and you know it.

In short, this "final" was an absolute embarrassment to the sport. Two mediocre teams battling it out for a title they clearly didn't deserve. Both squads need to fire their coaches and get some actual talent because this performance was an insult to football.</div>
