  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest rating of that starting XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Predrag Rajkovic:</strong> 6/10 - A decent shot-stopper, but lacks the presence and command that a top-class keeper needs. Prone to errors.
•   <strong>Filip Mladenovic:</strong> 5/10 - Work-rate and energy are there, but technically limited and often gets caught out defensively.
•   <strong>Milos Veljkovic:</strong> 6/10 - Solid enough, but lacks the pace and agility to deal with truly dangerous attackers.
•   <strong>Strahinja Pavlovic:</strong> 7/10 - Aggressive and committed. Can be rash and undisciplined at times, but has the potential to be great.
•   <strong>Nikola Milenkovic:</strong> 7.5/10 - A good defender with solid technique. Can play at RB, is reliable and consistent.
•   <strong>Dominik Szoboszlai:</strong> 8/10 - The one player that could make it to a great club. Good technique and shooting ability, although he can sometimes disappear in games.
•   <strong>Sergej Milinkovic-Savic:</strong> 7.5/10 - Underrated midfielder, but inconsistent and often disappears in crucial moments.
•   <strong>Filip Kostic:</strong> 7/10 - A quality crosser of the ball, but inconsistent.
•   <strong>Nemanja Radonjic:</strong> 4/10 - Way too inconsistent. Offers a decent pace but generally ineffective at the highest level.
•   <strong>Aleksandar Mitrovic:</strong> 8/10 - A physical presence and clinical finisher in the box. Limited outside of the area, but you know what you're getting.
•   <strong>Roland Sallai:</strong> 6/10 - Quick and hard-working, but lacks the quality to make a real difference at this level.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>Overall: 6.5/10</strong>

This team has some individual quality, especially in the midfield and attack. However, the defense is a major concern, with a lack of pace and vulnerability to set-pieces. The balance of the team is also questionable, with too many players who are inconsistent or lack the required work rate. While they can certainly cause problems for weaker opponents, they would struggle against top-tier teams.</div>
