  <h1>Description for 800px-Tottenham_Hotspur.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this Tottenham squad apart with brutally honest ratings:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Ange Postecoglou:</strong> 6/10. Overrated by many, his tactics are simple and easily countered. The results are evident.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Fraser Forster:</strong> 2/10. Washed up. Makes errors all the time. Should not be playing at this level.
•   <strong>Guglielmo Vicario:</strong> 7/10. Decent shot-stopper but nothing special, His distribution is suspect.
•   <strong>Alfie Whiteman:</strong> 1/10. Career backup at best.
•   <strong>Brandon Austin:</strong> 1/10. Same as Whiteman.
•   <strong>Antonin Kinsky:</strong> 3/10. Too young to have any real impact, probably a mistake.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Pedro Porro:</strong> 6/10. Mediocre defender.
•   <strong>Ben Davies:</strong> 4/10. Versatile but consistently exposed against quality opposition. Not good enough for a top team.
•   <strong>Kevin Danso:</strong> 6/10. He can be okay.
•   <strong>Cristian Romero:</strong> 6/10. Overrated and makes far too many errors. Liability waiting to happen.
•   <strong>Micky van de Ven:</strong> 6/10. Okay but needs a proper partner.
•   <strong>Radu Dragusin:</strong> 4/10. Not sure about this one.
•   <strong>Archie Gray:</strong> 2/10. Needs to be developed.
•   <strong>Sergio Reguilon:</strong> 3/10. Completely unreliable and injury-prone.
•   <strong>Djed Spence:</strong> 3/10. Another flop.
•   <strong>Destiny Udogie:</strong> 6/10. Raw talent but needs significant improvement in decision-making.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>James Maddison:</strong> 7/10. Good creator, but inconsistent and not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Rodrigo Bentancur:</strong> 6/10. Decent but injury problems.
•   <strong>Yves Bissouma:</strong> 5/10. Lazy and undisciplined. Fails to live up to his potential.
•   <strong>Pape Sarr:</strong> 4/10. Lacks the quality to be a regular starter.
•   <strong>Lucas Bergvall:</strong> 5/10. Still too young to have impact.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Dejan Kulusevski:</strong> 6/10. Can be good at times but lacks consistency and killer instinct.
•   <strong>Brennan Johnson:</strong> 6/10. Decent workrate but lacks the final product.
•   <strong>Wilson Odobert:</strong> 5/10. Needs development.
•   <strong>Mikey Moore:</strong> 2/10. Too young.
•   <strong>Heung-Min Son:</strong> 8/10. The only genuinely good player in the entire squad.
•   <strong>Timo Werner:</strong> 4/10. Misses too many chances.
•   <strong>Mathys Tel:</strong> 5/10. Has potential but unproven.
•   <strong>Dominic Solanke:</strong> 7/10. Good.
•   <strong>Richarlison:</strong> 3/10. Not good.
•   <strong>Dane Scarlett:</strong> 2/10. Not prem level.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

•   <strong>Tottenham Hotspur Squad:</strong> 4/10. Severely lacking depth in key areas and filled with overrated players. Needs a serious overhaul to compete for anything meaningful. They're basically a mid-table team with a couple of stars and a lot of dead weight.</div>
