  <h1>Description for 1920px-Flag_of_France.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect France's 2018 World Cup-winning squad with the honesty you requested. I won't hold back. This will be based on their form and impact at the time of the tournament:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Didier Deschamps (🇫🇷):</strong> 7/10 - Tactically rigid, often uninspired. He gets the job done and has an incredible amount of luck. He clearly struggled to unleash the team's attacking potential. Won the tournament, so you can't argue too much.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 7.5/10 - Solid, reliable, and a decent shot-stopper. His occasional brain farts did not cost France dearly.
•   <strong>Steve Mandanda (Marseille 🇫🇷):</strong> 5/10 - A capable backup, but clearly past his prime.
•   <strong>Alphonse Areola (Paris Saint-Germain 🇫🇷):</strong> 4/10 - Untested and unproven at this level.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Benjamin Pavard (VfB Stuttgart 🇩🇪):</strong> 7/10 - Surprise package. Scored an absolute worldie. He was solid defensively but nothing more.
•   <strong>Presnel Kimpembe (Paris Saint-Germain 🇫🇷):</strong> 5/10 - Raw potential but still too rash and inexperienced.
•   <strong>Raphaël Varane (Real Madrid 🇪🇸):</strong> 9/10 - Class act. Composed, dominant in the air, and his partnership with Umtiti was vital.
•   <strong>Samuel Umtiti (Barcelona 🇪🇸):</strong> 8/10 - Strong, physical, and generally reliable. His handball in the final was bad.
•   <strong>Adil Rami (Marseille 🇫🇷):</strong> 4/10 - Experienced but a liability waiting to happen.
•   <strong>Djibril Sidibé (Monaco 🇫🇷):</strong> 5/10 - Decent squad player, but injuries hampered his impact.
•   <strong>Lucas Hernandez (Atlético Madrid 🇪🇸):</strong> 7.5/10 - A real fighter. Defensively solid and added steel to the backline.
•   <strong>Benjamin Mendy (Manchester City 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 3/10 - Injured for most of the tournament.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Paul Pogba (Manchester United 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 8/10 - Showed glimpses of his brilliance but still inconsistent. Scored an important goal in the final.
•   <strong>Corentin Tolisso (Bayern Munich 🇩🇪):</strong> 6/10 - A useful squad player but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>N'Golo Kanté (Chelsea 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 9.5/10 - World-class. The engine of the team, constantly winning the ball back.
•   <strong>Blaise Matuidi (Juventus 🇮🇹):</strong> 6.5/10 - Disciplined and hardworking, but his limitations were often exposed.
•   <strong>Steven Nzonzi (Sevilla 🇪🇸):</strong> 5/10 - A late addition to the squad. He offered little dynamism.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Antoine Griezmann (Atlético Madrid 🇪🇸):</strong> 8.5/10 - Top performer. Scored crucial goals and linked play effectively.
•   <strong>Thomas Lemar (Monaco 🇫🇷):</strong> 4/10 - Hugely disappointing.
•   <strong>Olivier Giroud (Chelsea 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> 5/10 - Didn't score a single goal but his hold-up play was essential.
•   <strong>Kylian Mbappé (Paris Saint-Germain 🇫🇷):</strong> 9/10 - Exploded onto the world stage. Electric pace, skill, and a knack for scoring.
•   <strong>Ousmane Dembélé (Barcelona 🇪🇸):</strong> 4/10 - Injured for most of the tournament.
•   <strong>Nabil Fekir (Lyon 🇫🇷):</strong> 5.5/10 - Offered little in his substitute appearances.
•   <strong>Florian Thauvin (Marseille 🇫🇷):</strong> 3/10 - Had no impact.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 8/10</strong>

A squad with immense talent, especially in attack, but often underwhelming in terms of performance. Deschamps' pragmatic approach got them over the line. Their individual brilliance and solid defense were the keys to their success, not necessarily tactical masterclass. Overrated in terms of performance, but achieved the ultimate goal. That cannot be discredited.</div>
