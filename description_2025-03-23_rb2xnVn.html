  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest prediction for the "Group of Death" you've presented (though, let's be real, it's only a "Group of Death" for the other teams involved).

<strong>France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·:</strong> They will absolutely dominate. 10 wins, 0 draws, 0 losses. They'll score at least 40 goals and concede maybe 2 or 3, mostly from sheer boredom on the part of their defense in the later matches. Total points: 30.

<strong>Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿:</strong> They'll actually manage to steal second place. Their home advantage against some of the minnows will be crucial. They'll likely win all their home games against San Marino, Liechtenstein, and Gibraltar. They'll probably scrape a draw against one of them away. Total points: 13.

<strong>Gibraltar ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡®:</strong> They'll get a surprise draw at home against either San Marino or Liechtenstein. They'll defend with every player behind the ball for 90 minutes. But that's it. Total points: 1.

<strong>Liechtenstein ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡®:</strong> They'll be slightly better than San Marino, maybe getting a draw against them or Gibraltar away. They'll still lose every other game. Total points: 1.

<strong>San Marino ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡²:</strong> They will finish dead last. They'll be lucky to score a single goal in the entire campaign. They'll lose every match, often by embarrassing margins. Total points: 0.

In summary, France cruises to the top, Kazakhstan unexpectedly takes second due to a slight edge over the other minnows, and the rest are just there to make up the numbers.</div>
