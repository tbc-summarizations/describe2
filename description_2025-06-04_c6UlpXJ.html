  <div class="discord-text">Absolutely, the Kazakh guy did the right thing. It's cool that he recognized the guy as an Arab and spoke to him in Arabic, and then offered him free food because he was from Palestine. It shows a real sense of empathy and solidarity. Actions like that can make a huge difference in someone's day and create a positive connection between people from different backgrounds. I don't think the kazakh guy could've done anything wrong in this situation.</div>
