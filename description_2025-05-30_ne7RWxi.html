  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of two underrated clubs from each of those European top divisions:

•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹:</strong>
•   <strong>LASK:</strong> Consistently in the top half, but always overshadowed by Salzburg. Deserve more respect.
•   <strong>Wolfsberger AC:</strong> Solid mid-table team that occasionally challenges for European spots.

•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong>
•   <strong>Gent:</strong> Often a contender, but never quite reaching the heights of Brugge or Anderlecht.
•   <strong>Union Saint-Gilloise:</strong> Even though they had a good last season, they will remain underrated for a long time.

•   <strong>Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong>
•   <strong>Slovácko:</strong> Consistently performing well and even won the cup last season.
•   <strong>Sigma Olomouc:</strong> Historically decent club, often overlooked due to Prague's dominance.

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong>
•   <strong>Brighton:</strong> A team with a great coach and a good style of play.
•   <strong>Brentford:</strong> Surprised everyone upon being promoted to the Premier League, and continues to show good performance.

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷:</strong>
•   <strong>Lens:</strong> Good performance from last season.
•   <strong>Reims:</strong> A historic club that has struggled to regain its former glory, but still has potential.

•   <strong>Germany 🇩🇪:</strong>
•   <strong>Freiburg:</strong> Consistently overachieving with limited resources.
•   <strong>Union Berlin:</strong> The way they have risen through the ranks is admirable and should be a lesson to other clubs.

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong>
•   <strong>Aris Thessaloniki:</strong> Decent club with a strong fanbase, but always in the shadow of Olympiacos and PAOK.
•   <strong>Asteras Tripolis:</strong> Solid mid-table team that occasionally makes a run for European qualification.

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹:</strong>
•   <strong>Atalanta:</strong> Plays attractive football, but rarely mentioned among the top Serie A clubs.
•   <strong>Sassuolo:</strong> A smaller club that consistently punches above its weight.

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong>
•   <strong>Utrecht:</strong> One of the biggest clubs to never win the Eredivisie.
•   <strong>AZ Alkmaar:</strong> Always in the mix, but rarely gets the recognition it deserves.

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong>
•   <strong>Pogoń Szczecin:</strong> Good team that consistently fights for a place in European competitions.
•   <strong>Śląsk Wrocław:</strong> Decent team.

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong>
•   <strong>Braga:</strong> Decent club.
•   <strong>Vitória Guimarães:</strong> Historically a strong club.

•   <strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong>
•   <strong>Hearts:</strong> A historic club that has struggled to regain its former glory.
•   <strong>Hibernian:</strong> Edinburgh club that will remain underrated for a while.

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸:</strong>
•   <strong>Real Sociedad:</strong> Don't see them in the title race.
•   <strong>Villarreal:</strong> Good club.

•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭:</strong>
•   <strong>St. Gallen:</strong> Does well sometimes.
•   <strong>Lugano:</strong> Decent mid-table club.

•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷:</strong>
•   <strong>Trabzonspor:</strong> Historically a decent club.
•   <strong>Konyaspor:</strong> Solid mid-table.

•   <strong>Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong>
•   <strong>Zorya Luhansk:</strong> Okay team.
•   <strong>Vorskla Poltava:</strong> Decent mid-table club.</div>
