  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this XI with some brutal honesty:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Mike Maignan (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 8. A solid, reliable keeper, but not quite world-class in my book. He has good reflexes and distribution but can be prone to errors.

â€¢   <strong>Jules Kounde (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 7.5. Versatile and athletic, but sometimes gets caught out of position. His pace is a definite asset.

â€¢   <strong>Benjamin Pavard (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 6.5. Decent defender, but lacks the pace and agility to handle top wingers. His technique is pretty average as well.

â€¢   <strong>Virgil van Dijk (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±):</strong> 8.5. Still a commanding presence and a fantastic leader. He is arguably the best defender on the team.

â€¢   <strong>Denzel Dumfries (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±):</strong> 6.5. Strong physically and good going forward, but defensively questionable. Lacks the technical refinement of a top-tier full-back.

â€¢   <strong>N'Golo Kante (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 7.5. Used to be world-class, but injuries have taken their toll. Still a fantastic ball-winner, but his legs just aren't what they used to be.

â€¢   <strong>Adrien Rabiot (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 6.5. Inconsistent. Can be a good passer and has moments of brilliance, but also disappears in big games. Lacks composure.

â€¢   <strong>Marten De Roon (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±):</strong> 6. Solid defensively and hardworking, but limited in his passing range and creativity. A purely functional player.

â€¢   <strong>Eduardo Camavinga (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 7.5. Has immense potential and is already a good player, but can be frustratingly erratic. Needs to refine his decision-making.

â€¢   <strong>Randal Kolo Muani (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 7. A decent finisher with good movement, but not clinical enough to be considered elite. Needs to be more consistent.

â€¢   <strong>Kylian Mbappe (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):</strong> 9.5. One of the best players in the world, no doubt. Electric pace, incredible dribbling, and a lethal finisher. The only thing he lacks is consistency and leadership.

<strong>Team Rating (out of 10):</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Overall: 7.2</strong>. This team has talent but lacks balance and cohesion. The defense is a mixed bag, the midfield lacks true creativity and consistency, and while the attack is dangerous, it relies too heavily on Mbappe's brilliance. There are too many players who are "good" but not "great," and the lack of a true midfield maestro hurts the team's overall potential. It will lose against any top team, maybe except the worst ones.</div>
