  <h1>Description for IMG20250311124649.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, I see the image. That's a pretty weird selfie to take, even if it is of your classmate. Why would they use a picture of a dog as their selfie? It's kind of lame and doesn't really say much about their personality, other than maybe they like dogs? If they were trying to be quirky or funny, it didn't really land. It just comes across as a bit awkward and attention-seeking.</div>
