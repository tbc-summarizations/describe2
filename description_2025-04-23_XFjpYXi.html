  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-4sU-aB9prmhS.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into why these six characters got the boot and my unfiltered opinion on it:

•   <strong>\[A] - Alex Newton:</strong> This character probably got eliminated for being an abomination. The guy is ugly and makes the song even worse.

•   <strong>\[B] - Black Hole:</strong> This character most likely got the axe because his request was lame and it was a horrible asset. Like it's a black hole and it's asking to rejoin. Like give me a reason to do that.

•   <strong>\[C] - Stop Breathing:</strong> This one's a bit of a mix. There's no real reason to like him. he seems annoying and boring to be with.
 
•   <strong>\[D] - Cold Cow:</strong> Honestly, this one probably went because of its boringness. It's just a cow; what does it bring to the table? Minecraft is already a dumb game, don't even bring minecraft cows in the mix. 

•   <strong>\[E] - Goblin:</strong> Another generic thing that wasn't original and is a music album. Music Album = Dumb Gift. Get that out of here.
 
•   <strong>\[F] - Aldi:</strong> Another asset to make the show even worse. Please for the love of god don't use aldi for anything else.

So there you have it. Just my honest opinions. Let me know who wins.</div>
