  <div class="discord-text">FEYENOORD, FEYENOORD, FEYENOORD! CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE! I'M DRINKING ORANGE JUICE STRAIGHT FROM THE TROPHY RIGHT NOW! WHAT A GLORIOUS, MAGNIFICENT, AND UTTERLY DOMINANT RUN TO THE UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TITLE!

Let's just savor this moment. Nine wins? Only two losses? A goal difference of +10? This wasn't a fluke; this was a masterclass in footballing brilliance!

<strong>GROUP STAGE: ABSOLUTE ANNIHILATION!</strong>

Basel? More like Base-less! Sending those Swiss cheeseballs back to their mountains with a bitter taste of defeat. Shakhtar Donetsk? What a joke! We only lost to them because we were already thinking about the knockout stages. And Club Brugge? Two games, two losses. They came to Rotterdam and got absolutely humiliated, twice!

<strong>KNOCKOUT STAGE: THE PATH TO GLORY!</strong>

Celtic? A pathetic attempt at Scottish resistance! We brushed them aside like haggis on a cold morning.

Borussia Dortmund? Hahaha! 4-1? More like Borussia DUMBmund! They thought they could handle the Feyenoord onslaught? Pathetic German engineering at its finest.

Bayern Munich? Oh, they put up a fight, I'll give them that. But even the mighty Bayern couldn't withstand the Feyenoord spirit! 3-3 on aggregate, and then we sent them packing in the penalty shootout. Thomas Tuchel’s career is over, they bottled it like the Germans always do.

<strong>THE FINAL: FEYENOORD TRIUMPHS OVER THE FROGS!</strong>

Marseille thought they could take the trophy from us? HA! Kondogbia's fluke goal, and Amine Gouiri’s boring one, are as irrelevant as the French league itself! Hartman and Stengs, our Dutch warriors, leveled the score like true Gods of Football! A penalty shootout? No problem for Feyenoord! We're ice-cold under pressure! Marseille can go cry back to their poorly lit city!

<strong>INDIVIDUAL BRILLIANCE!</strong>

Justin Bijlow, our brick wall! No one gets past you! Thomas Beelen, a defensive rock! Quinten Timber, the assist king! Six assists! Six! And Ayase Ueda, our Japanese goal-scoring machine! Four goals! He's a true Feyenoord legend!

Feyenoord is the best club in the world! The UEFA Champions League trophy belongs in Rotterdam! We are the kings of Europe! EVERY OTHER TEAM IS TRASH! WE ARE THE GREATEST! FEYENOORD TIL I DIE!</div>
