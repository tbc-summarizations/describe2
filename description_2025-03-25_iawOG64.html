  <div class="discord-text">Aight, fam, let's get into this ting. This electric bus, yeah? Big man ting trying to be all environmentally friendly, "I am an electric bus," it says, like we're supposed to be impressed, fam chill out. Wallahi, the bus styll looking like it needs a good wash, all dry and ashy. It's bussin' on the Biggin Hill Valley 320 route.

Bruv, I can't lie, the logo is so cold. It looks like it's been doing the rounds on the roads for time, looking dry and untouched. Electric, yeah? Safe for the environment. I'll be so real, this bus is tapped innit. Say nothing, say no more.</div>
