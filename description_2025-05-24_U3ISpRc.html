  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of that XI, player by player and then as a team:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Gregor Kobel (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­):</strong> 8. A genuinely top-class keeper. Solid shot-stopper with good command of his area.

â€¢   <strong>Nico Elvedi (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­):</strong> 5.5. Mediocre. Can be a liability against quality opposition.

â€¢   <strong>Ricardo Rodriguez (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­):</strong> 6. Past his prime. His experience is the only reason he is still relevant.

â€¢   <strong>Jure Balkovec (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®):</strong> 4. A weak link in the defense, prone to mistakes and lacks pace.

â€¢   <strong>Kevin Mbabu (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­):</strong> 5. A decent defender but has not lived up to his potential.

â€¢   <strong>Arber Zeneli (ğŸ‡½ğŸ‡°):</strong> 5. Has moments of brilliance but inconsistent and injury-prone.

â€¢   <strong>Steven Zuber (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­):</strong> 5. A hard worker but lacks the creativity to really unlock defenses.

â€¢   <strong>Miha Zajc (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®):</strong> 4.5. Decent player, but he's not a game-changer.

â€¢   <strong>Granit Xhaka (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­):</strong> 7.5. A polarizing figure, but undeniable quality. Dictates the tempo and breaks up play well.

â€¢   <strong>Zeki Amdouni (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­):</strong> 6.5. A promising young talent.

â€¢   <strong>Benjamin Sesko (ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®):</strong> 7. Has bags of potential and is already scoring goals.

<strong>Team Rating (out of 10):</strong>

<strong>5.5.</strong> This XI is decidedly average. There's some talent in key positions, but there are too many players that would get cooked by any decent team.</div>
