  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's a dose of brutally honest predictions for those European World Cup Qualifiers:

<strong>Matchday 3:</strong>

•   <strong>Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 vs. Liechtenstein 🇱🇮:</strong> Wales will absolutely demolish Liechtenstein. It's a training session with a referee. No contest whatsoever.
•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰 vs. Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong> Belgium's talent will be too much for North Macedonia. Expect a comfortable, if not spectacular, win for the Red Devils. North Macedonia will get absolutely clowned.
•   <strong>Gibraltar 🇬🇮 vs. Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> This is a massacre waiting to happen. Croatia will use Gibraltar as target practice. Expect a cricket score.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪 vs. Israel 🇮🇱:</strong> A drab, low-scoring affair. Both teams lack the quality to truly threaten. Expect a boring draw or a narrow win for either side.
•   <strong>Norway 🇳🇴 vs. Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> Italy's tactical discipline and experience will grind down Norway's attacking flair. A tight win for the Azzurri.
•   <strong>Czechia 🇨🇿 vs. Montenegro 🇲🇪:</strong> Czechia's home advantage will be crucial. Expect a hard-fought win for them, but nothing pretty.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦 vs. San Marino 🇸🇲:</strong> San Marino are cannon fodder. Bosnia will win by a huge margin. Don't even bother watching this one.
•   <strong>Malta 🇲🇹 vs. Lithuania 🇱🇹:</strong> Two terrible teams battling it out. Expect a scrappy, error-filled game with a low score. Could go either way, but I'd slightly favor Lithuania.
•   <strong>Andorra 🇦🇩 vs. England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> A complete mismatch. England will run riot. Andorra might as well not even bother turning up.
•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹 vs. Romania 🇷🇴:</strong> A tight, physical encounter. Austria's slightly superior quality should see them edge it at home.
•   <strong>Finland 🇫🇮 vs. Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> The Netherlands will be too strong and technically gifted for Finland. Expect a solid win for the Oranje.
•   <strong>Albania 🇦🇱 vs. Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> A fiery Balkan derby. Serbia's attacking talent should be the difference, but expect a tense, ill-tempered match.

<strong>Matchday 4:</strong>

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 vs. North Macedonia 🇲🇰:</strong> A battle of mediocrity. Expect a dull draw, with neither team showing much ambition.
•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 vs. Moldova 🇲🇩:</strong> Italy will win comfortably. Moldova are simply not good enough to trouble them. A routine victory for the Azzurri.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪 vs. Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Norway's attacking talent will finally click. Expect a comfortable win for the Norwegians.
•   <strong>Croatia 🇭🇷 vs. Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> A tough test for Croatia. Czechia will make it difficult, but Croatia's class should prevail. A narrow win for the home side.
•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 vs. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Belgium will assert their dominance. Wales will struggle to contain their attacking threat. A fairly comfortable win for Belgium.
•   <strong>Faroe Islands 🇫🇴 vs. Gibraltar 🇬🇮:</strong> A grim affair. Expect a low-scoring draw or a narrow win for the Faroe Islands. Not one for the neutrals.
•   <strong>Finland 🇫🇮 vs. Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> A close game. Poland's star power should see them edge it, but Finland will put up a good fight.
•   <strong>San Marino 🇸🇲 vs. Austria 🇦🇹:</strong> Another thrashing. Austria will use San Marino as a punching bag. Don't waste your time watching this.
•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. Malta 🇲🇹:</strong> The Netherlands will dominate. Malta will be lucky to keep the score down. A comfortable victory for the Oranje.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 vs. Andorra 🇦🇩:</strong> Serbia will win easily. Andorra are out of their depth. A routine victory for the home side.
•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴 vs. Cyprus 🇨🇾:</strong> Romania should win this comfortably at home. Cyprus are not a strong team.
•   <strong>Latvia 🇱🇻 vs. Albania 🇦🇱:</strong> Albania has more quality and will likely secure an away victory, leaving Latvia disappointed.

There you have it. Straightforward, brutally honest, and hopefully, accurate. Don't come crying to me if I'm wrong.</div>
