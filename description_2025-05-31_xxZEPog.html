  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my unfiltered take on these Round of 16 matches:

<strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 0-2 Switzerland 🇨🇭:</strong> England, what a joke! Getting knocked out by Switzerland? Looks like they forgot to bring their "football's coming home" chants. Maybe they should try bringing some actual skill next time.

<strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 3-1 Romania 🇷🇴:</strong> Expected. Belgium barely scraped by.

<strong>Hungary 🇭🇺 0-0 Croatia 🇭🇷 (Hungary wins 4-2 on penalties 🇭🇺):</strong> Hungary winning on penalties? Must have been a truly boring match. Croatia bottled it in the shootout. Shocked to see them lose to Hungary, I expected them to go much further.

<strong>Portugal 🇵🇹 2-0 Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> Predictable. Ronaldo still carrying the team I see. Poor Serbia never really stood a chance against a team with CR7 still trying to prove he's relevant.

<strong>Italy 🇮🇹 2-0 Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Italy doing what they should. Norway is as usual, below expectations. No surprises here.

<strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 2-1 Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> Netherlands barely squeaking by Sweden is not impressive. They really struggle to get past their opponents. 

<strong>France 🇫🇷 0-0 Germany 🇩🇪 (France wins 5-4 on penalties 🇫🇷):</strong> A goalless draw between France and Germany? Proof that even big teams can serve up a snoozefest. Germany choking in the penalties again, same old story.

<strong>Spain 🇪🇸 4-0 Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Spain showing no mercy to Wales! Maybe Wales should stick to rugby. Embarrassing performance, they got completely demolished.</div>
