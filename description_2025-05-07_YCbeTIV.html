  <div class="discord-text">The media file shows a Roblox game where players are attempting to repair a core. The core is depicted as a glowing orb surrounded by machines shooting lasers at it. As the repairs proceed, the energy levels fluctuate. One of the players initiates a shutdown, but it fails, activating a self-destruct sequence with a 120-second countdown. The lasers become damaged, and the visuals intensify, indicating a major explosion will occur soon. Despite this, some players are still present in the room as the countdown continues.</div>
