  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this XI with some hard truths:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Unai Simon:</strong> 5/10. He's had some shaky moments and isn't exactly a world-beater. Can make a good save, but prone to errors.
•   <strong>Lucas Digne:</strong> 6/10. Solid, reliable, but doesn't offer much going forward and can be exposed defensively against top-tier wingers.
•   <strong>Pepe:</strong> 7/10. Age is catching up, but his experience and sheer will are undeniable. Still capable of a good performance, but a liability against pace.
•   <strong>Nacho:</strong> 6/10. Versatile, can fill in, but not a standout. Lacks the physical presence and technical ability to be a top-class defender.
•   <strong>Denzel Dumfries:</strong> 7/10. Energetic, good going forward, but defensively suspect. His attacking output often outweighs his defensive lapses.
•   <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum:</strong> 6/10. Can be a powerful presence in midfield but prone to disappearing in big games. Lacks consistency.
•   <strong>Dani Olmo:</strong> 7/10. Creative and technically gifted, but inconsistent. Needs to add more goals and assists to his game to truly shine.
•   <strong>N'Golo Kante:</strong> 8/10. A workhorse, covers every blade of grass, but his attacking contributions are limited. Still a world-class destroyer.
•   <strong>Fabian Ruiz:</strong> 6/10. Technically gifted, but lacks the physicality and defensive awareness to be a complete midfielder.
•   <strong>Alvaro Morata:</strong> 4/10. Misses far too many chances for a striker at this level. Work rate is there, but finishing is woeful.
•   <strong>Kylian Mbappe:</strong> 9/10. A genuine superstar, capable of game-changing moments. Pace, skill, and finishing make him a nightmare for defenders.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>6.5/10.</strong>

This team is a mixed bag. Mbappe is the clear standout, and Kante provides steel in midfield. However, there are too many question marks over the defense and finishing ability. The midfield lacks a true creative spark to consistently unlock defenses. Ultimately, this team would struggle against top-tier opposition due to its inconsistencies and defensive vulnerabilities. They'd be more likely to frustrate than dominate.</div>
