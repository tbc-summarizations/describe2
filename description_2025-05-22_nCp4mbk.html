  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of that XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Mike Maignan:</strong> 8/10 - Top-tier keeper, great shot-stopper and commands his area well.
•   <strong>Virgil van Dijk:</strong> 7/10 - Still good, but not the world-beater he once was. Age is catching up, impacting his pace and agility.
•   <strong>Nathan Aké:</strong> 6/10 - Solid, dependable, but nothing spectacular. A decent squad player.
•   <strong>Jules Koundé:</strong> 7/10 - Talented, but can be inconsistent. Has the potential to be world-class, but needs to mature.
•   <strong>Benjamin Pavard:</strong> 5/10 - Can be quite average, prone to mistakes and lacks the pace to recover.
•   <strong>Eduardo Camavinga:</strong> 6/10 - Great prospect, can play the defense and midfield roles well, but still raw and prone to errors.
•   <strong>N'Golo Kanté:</strong> 7/10 - Even if he's past his prime he's a great mid fielder.
•   <strong>Adrien Rabiot:</strong> 5/10 - Inconsistent, can have moments of brilliance but often goes missing in big games.
•   <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum:</strong> 3/10 - Completely fallen off the map, has very little to offer at this stage.
•   <strong>Kylian Mbappé:</strong> 9/10 - World-class, a constant threat, and one of the best finishers in the game.
•   <strong>Memphis Depay:</strong> 5/10 - Underwhelming, has flashes of brilliance but struggles for consistency and often disappears in crucial moments.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5/10</strong> - This team has a lot of flaws, that could be easily exploited by opposition teams. The mix of nationalities and players who are past their prime make this team an easy win for any team to face, especially the top teams.</div>
