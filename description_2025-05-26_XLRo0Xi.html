  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest summary of those UCL quarter-final results, roasting every team involved:

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain vs. Aston Villa (5-4):</strong> PSG, managed to win against the farmer team, Aston Villa in an embarrassment manner, that would have been an upset if a farmer team eliminated them.
•   <strong>Arsenal vs. Real Madrid (5-1):</strong> I feel bad for Madrid as they got absolutely battered by the Gunners. Embarrassing for a club with such history, they were treated like a mid-table team in both legs. Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid would be so embarrassed to see this.
•   <strong>Barcelona vs. Borussia Dortmund (5-3):</strong> Barcelona absolutely destroyed Dortmund in the first leg, only to almost bottle it in the second. Classic Barca move of the year.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich vs. Inter Milan (3-4):</strong> Bayern, what a waste of talent. Losing to Inter? Pathetic! You had all the firepower in the world and you let them steal the show. Your second leg could have been your comeback but you blew it. Inter Milan, barely scraping by against a choking Bayern. Congrats, you won, but no one's impressed.</div>
