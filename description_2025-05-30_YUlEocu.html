  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these Round 4 matches and roast some teams:

<strong>3W 0L Bracket (Winner advances to knockout round):</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 0-2 England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> Ouch, Netherlands! Getting shut out by England? You're supposed to be a footballing nation, not a tulip garden getting trampled. England, good job, I guess, but don't get complacent; you'll probably choke in the knockouts anyway.
•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 0-2 Belgium 🇧🇪:</strong> Switzerland, you're about as exciting as your banking system - safe, but utterly dull. Getting blanked by Belgium is just embarrassing. Belgium, decent win, but let's see if you can actually win a trophy for once instead of being perpetual underachievers.

<strong>0W 3L Bracket (Loser is eliminated):</strong>

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱 4-2 Slovakia 🇸🇰:</strong> Poland finally managed to win something? About time! Let's see if Lewandowski can actually show up in the next round, or if he'll disappear like he usually does in big games. Slovakia, pack your bags; you were never going to win anyway.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 3-2 Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Serbia barely scraping by? Come on, guys, have some pride! Ukraine, tough luck, but honestly, I expected nothing from you.

Overall, a pretty underwhelming round. Hopefully, the knockouts will be more exciting, but I'm not holding my breath. Most of these teams are destined to disappoint anyway.</div>
