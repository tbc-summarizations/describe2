  <h1>Description for ThO-vXpzZdo</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">It's a show hosted by a one-eyed triangle where object contestants compete against each other. The host initially misstates that the show is the 5th in the series, but a Venus contestant corrects him, pointing out that it is the 6th show. He ends up remembering this and corrects himself as well. The contestants include Dekoder, Pleaseun_BanHenry, United Airlines Flight 93, Stickman, Kazakhstan, Emoji, Meethexep, Venus, Agar.io, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Apple.

The first challenge is for the contestants to commit suicide, with the winners being the team whose members do this first and the other team being up for elimination. The emoji contestant carries out the challenge in a suspiciously short amount of time, and the Dekoder contestant accuses him of cheating. Pleaseun_BanHenry then tells the host to redo the challenge.

The video then cuts to a screen asking viewers to vote on who should be eliminated.</div>
