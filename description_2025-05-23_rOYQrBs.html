  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest prediction for those UCL quarter-final matches, with aggregate scorelines:

•   <strong>Fulham 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 vs. Lyon 🇫🇷: 2-3</strong> Fulham will put up a decent fight, but Lyon's squad has too much firepower. The French side advances, but they won't dominate.

•   <strong>Celtic 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 vs. Bodrum 🇹🇷: 5-0</strong> This is going to be a massacre. Celtic is in a different league, and Bodrum will be lucky to keep it respectable.

•   <strong>LASK 🇦🇹 vs. Mainz 05 🇩🇪: 1-4</strong> LASK just aren't good enough. Mainz have the quality and tactical edge to dismantle them over two legs, even though it will be hard-fought.

•   <strong>AZ 🇳🇱 vs. Getafe 🇪🇸: 1-2</strong> This is going to be a dirty, low-scoring affair. Getafe will grind out the result with their defensive tactics and will edge it due to their experience in these kinds of games. It'll be ugly.</div>
