  <h1>Description for m91KXVd.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutal take on those words based on the frequency list you provided:

•   <strong>"the"</strong>: Overused, basic, and boring. Everyone relies on it too much. It's the vanilla ice cream of words.
•   <strong>"NIGGER"</strong>: Offensive, ignorant, and totally unacceptable. It should be removed from common vocabulary and not ever be tolerated.
•   <strong>"to"</strong>: Another necessary but dull word. It just points things in a direction; not exactly exciting.
•   <strong>"a"</strong>: Even simpler than "the," and equally bland. It's the white bread of the English language.
•   <strong>"i"</strong>: Self-centered and often overused. Narcissistic in its very nature.
•   <strong>"and"</strong>: A connector, but a lazy one. There are more interesting ways to link ideas.
•   <strong>"you"</strong>: Can be accusatory, but also essential for conversation. Use it wisely, or you'll sound like you're nagging.
•   <strong>"is"</strong>: A state of being... or a state of being boring. It just declares things.
•   <strong>"in"</strong>: Inside... whatever. Very context-dependent.
•   <strong>"-"</strong>: (Hyphen) Useful for joining words, but not a word itself. Still, it serves a purpose.
•   <strong>"it"</strong>: Vague and impersonal. Good for referring to things without naming them, but can be evasive.
•   <strong>"I"</strong>: See "i." Still self-centered.
•   <strong>"of"</strong>: Shows possession, but in a roundabout way.
•   <strong>"that"</strong>: Can be used to distance yourself from something.
•   <strong>"will"</strong>: Projects into the future, which is at least ambitious.
•   <strong>"for"</strong>: Indicates purpose, which is a step up from just existing.
•   <strong>"my"</strong>: Still self-absorbed. Are you going to talk about yourself the whole time?
•   <strong>"this"</strong>: Points to something specific, but lacks imagination.
•   <strong>"can"</strong>: Implies possibility, which is more optimistic than "is."
•   <strong>"with"</strong>: Indicates connection or association.
•   <strong>"be"</strong>: The foundation of many sentences, but ultimately bland.
•   <strong>"but"</strong>: A contradiction, an obstacle. Necessary for conflict.
•   <strong>"so"</strong>: Often used as filler. Can be used as a replacement for "therefore," which is lazy.
•   <strong>"like"</strong>: Overused and often meaningless, especially when used as a filler word.
•   <strong>"on"</strong>: Indicates position, but not a very descriptive one.
•   <strong>"me"</strong>: Still talking about yourself?
•   <strong>"have"</strong>: Implies possession, which can be greedy.
•   <strong>"@Clyde"</strong>: Pointless.
•   <strong>"not"</strong>: Negative and limiting. A downer of a word.
•   <strong>"are"</strong>: Similar to "is," but plural. Still boring.
•   <strong>"do"</strong>: An action word, which is a slight improvement.
•   <strong>"or"</strong>: Presents a choice, which is more interesting than just stating facts.
•   <strong>"was"</strong>: Something that used to be, but isn't anymore. Slightly nostalgic.
•   <strong>"what"</strong>: Asks a question, which is better than making a statement.
•   <strong>"as"</strong>: Used for comparisons, which can be insightful.
•   <strong>"he"</strong>: Refers to someone else, which is less self-centered than "I."
•   <strong>"ok"</strong>: A weak agreement. Shows a lack of strong opinions.
•   <strong>"bro"</strong>: Only tolerable among close friends, otherwise, it's just annoying.
•   <strong>"just"</strong>: Often used to minimize or downplay something.
•   <strong>"they"</strong>: Refers to a group, which can be powerful or divisive.
•   <strong>"no"</strong>: A firm refusal. Direct, but potentially confrontational.
•   <strong>"from"</strong>: Indicates origin. At least it tells you where something comes from.</div>
