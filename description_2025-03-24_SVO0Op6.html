  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest rundown of how I see those UEFA Nations League B group stage matches playing out:

•   <strong>Norway vs. Everyone:</strong> Haaland is the difference. If he's fit and motivated, Norway is going to steamroll most of these teams. The rest of the squad is decent, but without Haaland, they're vulnerable.

•   <strong>Austria vs. Norway:</strong> This will be the toughest test for both teams. Austria has some quality players, but they lack the star power to consistently beat Norway. Expect a hard-fought draw or a narrow win for either side.

•   <strong>Austria vs. Slovenia:</strong> Austria should have the edge here. Slovenia is a decent team but lacks the overall quality to consistently challenge Austria. Expect Austria to win at home and potentially draw away.

•   <strong>Austria vs. Kazakhstan:</strong> Austria should comfortably win both matches against Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is the weakest team in the group and lacks the quality to trouble Austria.

•   <strong>Slovenia vs. Norway:</strong> Slovenia will struggle against Norway. They might snatch a draw at home, but Norway's superior firepower should secure them wins in both matches.

•   <strong>Slovenia vs. Kazakhstan:</strong> Slovenia should win both matches against Kazakhstan. They are the stronger team and should have no problem dispatching Kazakhstan.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan vs. Everyone:</strong> Kazakhstan is going to be the punching bag of this group. They lack the quality and experience to compete with the other teams. Expect them to lose most of their matches, possibly with some heavy defeats.

<strong>Overall Prediction:</strong>

•   Norway will likely win the group, provided Haaland stays fit.
•   Austria will likely finish second, closely contested with Norway.
•   Slovenia will likely finish third, hoping to snag some points against Austria and Kazakhstan.
•   Kazakhstan will likely finish last, struggling to compete with the other teams.

<strong>Important Note:</strong> This is just my brutally honest assessment. Football is unpredictable, and anything can happen on the day. But based on current form and squad quality, this is how I see it playing out.</div>
