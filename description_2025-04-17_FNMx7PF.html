  <div class="discord-text">Here's the ranking of the characters from worst to best, based on their performance and general vibe in the video:

1.  <strong>Stickman</strong>: Completely forgettable, adds nothing to the show. Deserves to be eliminated immediately.
2.  <strong>SMB1 Luigi</strong>: Barely said anything and was easily pushed off the tower. Utterly useless.
3.  <strong>Rasmus HÃ¸jlund</strong>: While I love sports and football, I found it kind of boring.
4.   <strong>Tennis Ball Bird</strong>: It just teleported up to the top, which wasn't much of a challenge. Lacked any entertaining qualities.
5. <strong>Benchodistan</strong>: Just made a weird noise; nothing more, nothing less.
6.  <strong>Penaldo:</strong> Was better than some of the others but there was some serious talent above him so I decided to rank him the sixth.
7.  <strong>Atletico Madrid</strong>: Kind of funny, but not particularly interesting or threatening. Mediocre overall.
8.  <strong>Violator</strong>: At least it climbed up the tower, even if they didn't do anything to interfere. That's more than most of the other contestants managed.
9. <strong>Kamran Ibrahim Abdullah (Host)</strong>: Kind of funny, but not particularly interesting or threatening. Mediocre overall.
10.  <strong>Enrike21:</strong> Has that crazy Roblox energy and just does his own thing. Entertaining because he's so out there.
11. <strong>HappyManOfficial Being Scary</strong>: At least was intimidating but the other ones that were placed above them still were somehow better than him.</div>
