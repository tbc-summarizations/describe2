  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest ranking of which of those 20 characters should debut in Battle For Nitrous, from least to most deserving:

20. <strong>Toilet:</strong> Absolutely not. Toilet humor is usually lazy. Battle For Nitrous is above that.

19. <strong>Afghanistan:</strong> This feels like a really bad attempt at shock value. It's distasteful and lazy. No need for real-world tragedy used for internet points.

18. <strong>Porkchop:</strong> Justâ€¦ why? It's uninspired and not funny. We need creativity, not random food items.

17. <strong>Lil B:</strong> Sorry, but the "based god" meme is long dead. Lil B's schtick is too dated to have any impact now.

16. <strong>Parlo Thumbnail:</strong> So it's some random thumbnail? That is really lame compared to other contestants.

15. <strong>YXuvg( U[iZ}v3.w !]$PTy OWS(&gt; L~^q8t:</strong> A jumble of characters? Utter nonsense is not the way to go.

14. <strong>Garbage Human:</strong> Edgy, but kinda bland. There are more creative ways to do "unlikable" characters.

13. <strong>Coke Vanilla:</strong> Fine, but not exciting. Could be used for like, marketing or something but not worth an actual character spot.

12. <strong>Kai Cenat:</strong> Would just be constant screaming and yelling for views. Not enjoyable.

11. <strong>Strawberry Meeth:</strong> Sounds kinda gross and weird.

10. <strong>Tierlisty:</strong> It'd just be constant arguing over where things rank and what opinions are valid. Annoying.

9. <strong>Saturn:</strong> Could look cool but it doesn't have that much to it.

8. <strong>Hydrogen Bomb:</strong> Potentially destructive and OP, but could be balanced well. I'd have to see the stats first.

7. <strong>GD King Von:</strong> Sure, I don't see a problem with this but it could be seen as controversial.

6. <strong>GMDCarti:</strong> Sure, I don't see a problem with this but it could be seen as controversial.

5. <strong>Hyperlaser Gun:</strong> This has potential for some cool visual effects and offensive power.

4. <strong>M-16:</strong> An overpowered beast, can be annoying for other players as it is too OP.

3. <strong>Black Circle:</strong> A visually striking character with potentially interesting abilities. Could be very intimidating.

2. <strong>White Hole:</strong> A mind-bending character with unusual powers. Could be incredibly disruptive in a fun way.

1. <strong>Pulse Demon:</strong> A truly terrifying character that exudes fear and dread. A great choice to create a sense of panic and tension in the game.</div>
