  <h1>Description for image0.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the age ranges based on those profile pics:

•   <strong>mindset</strong>: 25-35. That generic, atmospheric profile picture screams someone who's trying to appear deep and introspective, but is likely just average.

•   <strong>AdamMady</strong>: 18-24. The bird in a suit probably is satire, so the user probably is around college age.

•   <strong>AJ</strong>: 20-30. The outdoorsy, nature-scene pic suggests someone who's trying to look like they have their life together, but are still young enough to be trying.

•   <strong>andrejtb</strong>: 25-40. The emoji thing kinda means that he has an ok sense of humor and is fairly older.

•   <strong>BDYT</strong>: 14-22. I'd put money on this being a teenager or very young adult. The anime profile picture is the ultimate sign that she is weeb.

•   <strong>finomano</strong>: 20-40. The discord avatar means he is likely a user who is involved with technology.

•   <strong>HappyMan</strong>: 16-25. The meme pfp means that he probably saw it somewhere and set it as his own, meaning that he is likely around college age.

•   <strong>Berishbaev</strong>: 25-45. A scenic picture, combined with a quote, implies someone who's trying to present an air of sophistication.

•   <strong>Meethexep</strong>: 13-20. That "deal with it" glasses on a cat wearing wintery stuff profile picture reeks of someone who thinks they're edgy and cool. Probably a teenager.

•   <strong>Salle</strong>: 25-35. The strange avatar suggests someone who is trying to be different, and looks pretty lame to me.</div>
