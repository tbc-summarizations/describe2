  <h1>Description for 1024px-Brentford_FC_crest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the Brentford squad, no sugarcoating:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Thomas Frank:</strong> 7/10. He's shown he can build a cohesive team and get results, but there's a tactical ceiling they keep bumping their heads on. Seems a bit too reliant on the same formula.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Mark Flekken:</strong> 6/10. Decent shot-stopper, but prone to errors. Not a clear upgrade over what they had.
•   <strong>Hákon Rafn Valdimarsson:</strong> 4/10. Untested in a major league. Potential is there, but right now, he's a liability waiting to happen.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Kristoffer Vassbakk Ajer:</strong> 5/10. Inconsistent. Shows flashes of quality but lacks the composure and reliability needed at this level.
•   <strong>Michael Kayode:</strong> 4/10. A youngster who is raw and lacks some of the basics of defending.
•   <strong>Ben Mee:</strong> 7/10. A solid veteran, but age is catching up to him. Can still organize a defense, but lacks pace and mobility.
•   <strong>Ethan Pinnock:</strong> 6/10. Physically imposing but technically limited. Can be exposed by quicker, more skillful attackers.
•   <strong>Sepp van den Berg:</strong> 6/10. Decent when healthy but has a history with injuries.
•   <strong>Nathan Collins:</strong> 5/10. Overrated and overpriced. Makes too many rash decisions and lacks positional awareness.
•   <strong>Ji-Soo Kim:</strong> 3/10. Too inexperienced for the Premier League. Likely a squad player at best.
•   <strong>Rico Henry:</strong> 7/10. When fit, is very good on the ball and in attack but has injury issues.
•   <strong>Keane Lewis-Potter:</strong> 5/10. Versatile, but doesn't excel in any particular role. A useful squad player, but not a game-changer.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Christian Nørgaard:</strong> 7/10. A steady presence in midfield, but lacks creativity. Good at breaking up play, but not a playmaker.
•   <strong>Vitaly Janelt:</strong> 6/10. Energetic and hardworking, but limited technically. Can be overrun by more skillful midfielders.
•   <strong>Yegor Yarmolyuk:</strong> 4/10. Unproven. Too inconsistent for the Premier League.
•   <strong>Mathias Jensen:</strong> 7/10. Good vision and passing range, but lacks the physicality to dominate midfield battles.
•   <strong>Edmond-Paris Maghoma:</strong> 5/10. Promising but needs more development. Still raw and makes too many mistakes.
•   <strong>Yunus Emre Konak:</strong> 4/10. Another unknown quantity. Likely to struggle adapting to the pace and physicality of the Premier League.
•   <strong>Aaron Hickey:</strong> 7/10. Talented full-back with a good engine, but injury-prone. Needs to stay fit to fulfill his potential.
•   <strong>Mikkel Damsgaard:</strong> 5/10. Overhyped. Hasn't lived up to expectations and lacks consistency.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Bryan Mbuemo:</strong> 8/10. Their most dangerous player. Quick, skillful, and a decent finisher. Needs to stay fit for Brentford to have a chance.
•   <strong>Fabio Carvalho:</strong> 6/10. Lacks a clinical edge and doesn't always make the right decisions in the final third.
•   <strong>Kevin Schade:</strong> 5/10. Disappointing. Hasn't shown the quality needed to justify his price tag.
•   <strong>Gustavo Gomes:</strong> 3/10. Never heard of this guy, might be bad for Brentford.
•   <strong>Yoane Wissa:</strong> 6/10. A decent finisher, but inconsistent. Can be a threat on his day, but lacks the quality to be a consistent goalscorer.
•   <strong>Joshua Dasilva:</strong> 4/10. Injury-prone and often ineffective when he does play. A liability.
•   <strong>Thiago Rodrigues:</strong> 3/10. A good dribbler but does not offer much in the way of end product.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

•   <strong>5/10</strong>. This is a mid-table squad at best. They lack the quality and depth to compete with the top teams. Unless they make some significant improvements, they'll be fighting for survival.</div>
