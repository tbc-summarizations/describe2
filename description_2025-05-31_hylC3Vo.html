  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this round looks like a mixed bag of disappointment and mediocrity.

<strong>Slovenia 2-0 Iceland:</strong> Iceland, seriously? Still living off that one good Euro run? Slovenia probably beat you by just showing up. Get some new players.

<strong>Croatia 2-1 Austria:</strong> Croatia barely scraping by against Austria? This is what we call a "meh" result. Croatia's supposed to be a footballing nation, but they're playing like they're allergic to scoring goals. Austria, you almost got a lucky draw, but that's not going to cut it in the long run.

<strong>Finland 0-0 Denmark (Finland wins 4-2 on penalties):</strong> Oh god, a 0-0 draw decided by penalties? That's the footballing equivalent of watching paint dry. Congratulations, Finland, on being slightly less bad at penalties. Denmark, how embarrassing to lose on penalties to Finland? Maybe your players should learn to kick the ball properly.

<strong>Czechia 2-1 Germany:</strong> Finally, something mildly interesting. Germany losing to Czechia? Classic German underperformance. Maybe they should try playing with some actual passion instead of just relying on reputation. Czechia, enjoy your fleeting moment of glory, because you'll probably lose next round.

<strong>Spain 2-0 Sweden:</strong> Spain putting Sweden in their place. Good, Sweden is overrated anyway. Spain, don't get too cocky, you're still not as good as you used to be.

<strong>Romania 1-0 North Macedonia:</strong> Romania eking out a win against North Macedonia? This is what we call a "who cares" match. Both teams are irrelevant, and the scoreline reflects the excitement level. Honestly, this match is just boring.</div>
