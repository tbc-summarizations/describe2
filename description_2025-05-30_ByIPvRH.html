  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's the brutally honest take on these matches.

<strong>1W 0L Group - The "Slightly Less Terrible" Division:</strong>

•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 2-1 Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> Switzerland scraping by against a Germany that's been underperforming for far too long. Germany, you used to be feared; now you're just a slightly above-average disappointment. Clean up the mess.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 1-0 Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> Typical England, a boring, narrow win against a team nobody expected anything from anyway. "It's coming home"... eventually, maybe, if every other team spontaneously combusts.
•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 2-1 Iceland 🇮🇸:</strong> Turkey manages to win against Iceland, they are usually mid but Iceland is struggling, which makes this win only slightly impressive, not even close.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦 0-2 Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> Bosnia, bless your heart, you tried. But the Netherlands finally looks like they remembered they have some quality players.
•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴 1-3 Austria 🇦🇹:</strong> Austria, showing some teeth, finally! Romania, back to the drawing board. You're about as threatening as a kitten in a lion's den.
•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 3-1 Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> France reminding everyone why they're still the team to beat. Spain is overrated. Time for some new blood.
•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 1-0 Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> Belgium narrowly edging out Portugal. Ronaldo is getting old, and the rest of your team needs a serious wake-up call.
•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 1-0 Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Wales can barely do anything, while Denmark finally pulls up with the talent to not fall flat

<strong>0W 1L Group - The "Oh God, It's Painful to Watch" Division:</strong>

•   <strong>Sweden 🇸🇪 3-0 Finland 🇫🇮:</strong> Sweden asserting dominance against their Finnish neighbors. Finland, maybe stick to ice hockey, or anything else.
•   <strong>Slovakia 🇸🇰 0-1 Albania 🇦🇱:</strong> Slovakia managed to screw up and lose to Albania, time to step up.
•   <strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 2-3 Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> Scotland can't hold onto a lead to save their lives. Croatia is better, no problem.
•   <strong>Hungary 🇭🇺 2-1 Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> Hungary barely pulls a win over Ukraine. Ukraine you are the best, but at least try a little.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸 0-2 Italy 🇮🇹:</strong> Serbia completely collapsed. Italy, not amazing but you manage to have this bad team lose.
•   <strong>Norway 🇳🇴 0-2 Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> Haaland is wasting his talent, time to leave Norway.
•   <strong>North Macedonia 🇲🇰 1-3 Slovenia 🇸🇮:</strong> North Macedonia, you're about as exciting as watching paint dry. Slovenia, congrats on beating them, I guess?
•   <strong>Georgia 🇬🇪 1-0 Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> Georgia shocking a Poland team that has forgotten how to play football. Poland, seriously, what's going on?

Overall, this round was a mixed bag of mediocrity, with a few sparks of actual excitement. Time to step it up, teams, or prepare for utter humiliation.</div>
