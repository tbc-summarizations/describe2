  <div class="discord-text"><strong>Jesus:</strong> "Look at you lot, dressed like common street urchins. What makes you think you're worthy of an audience with me?"

<strong>John Lennon:</strong> "Oi, mate, we're the Beatles. We're bigger than you anyway. Heard you been hanging around with a prostitute, is that true?"

<strong>Jesus:</strong> "Heathen! Blasphemer! You dare speak to me in such a manner? I am the son of God!"

<strong>George Harrison:</strong> "Yeah, well, my dad can beat up your dad, so get over it"

<strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> "Hey Jesus. How are you hanging? Are you gonna join us on tour?"

<strong>Jesus:</strong> "I can't even understand what you're saying! You guys seem like a bunch of foreigners. Go back to where you came from!"

<strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> "We'll take our music and go! You can stay here with your sandals and your dusty robes."

<strong>Jesus:</strong> "Good riddance! May God have mercy on your souls!"</div>
