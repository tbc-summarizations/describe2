  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a brutally honest take on how that UEFA Euro 2024 qualifier group will likely shake out:

1.  <strong>Portugal:</strong> They're winning the group. No question. Even if they're slightly past their peak, the sheer talent and experience dwarf everyone else. If they don't win the group, it's a monumental failure.
2.  <strong>Slovakia:</strong> Realistically, they're fighting for second place or a playoff spot. They're decent, but very inconsistent. Expect them to struggle against Portugal and drop points where they shouldn't.
3.  <strong>Bosnia:</strong> They will have moments of brilliance followed by inexplicable collapses. The talent is there, but the mentality rarely is. 
4.  <strong>Iceland:</strong> They're a shadow of their former selves. The magic of 2016 is long gone, and they lack the quality to seriously challenge for anything. They'll be fighting for pride.
5.  <strong>Luxembourg:</strong> They might steal a point or two against some of the bigger teams, but ultimately, they'll be fighting to stay out of last place.
6.  <strong>Liechtenstein:</strong> They are there to make up the numbers. Expect them to lose every game by a comfortable margin and serve as a confidence booster for the other teams.

<strong>Overall:</strong> It will be a snoozefest for first place. Portugal winning this group shouldn't even be a question. The real drama will be in the fight for second place.</div>
