  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the predicted results for the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League C group stage matches between Romania, Kosovo, Cyprus, and Lithuania:

<strong>Romania vs. Kosovo:</strong> Romania's got a slight edge, but Kosovo's fighting spirit makes them a tricky opponent. Expect a tight, physical match. My prediction is a 1-0 win for Romania. They'll probably try to grind it out.

<strong>Cyprus vs. Lithuania:</strong> This one's going to be a snoozefest. Both teams are weak and uninspired. Probably a 0-0 draw with very few shots on target. Don't expect any excitement.

<strong>Romania vs. Cyprus:</strong> Another win for Romania. Cyprus just doesn't have the quality to compete. Expect a comfortable 2-0 victory for Romania. Cyprus's defense will crumble.

<strong>Kosovo vs. Lithuania:</strong> Kosovo should win this one easily. Lithuania's attack is toothless, and Kosovo's midfield will dominate. A 3-0 win for Kosovo.

<strong>Cyprus vs. Romania:</strong> Romania will dominate again. This is likely going to be a 3-1 win for Romania.

<strong>Lithuania vs. Kosovo:</strong> This will be another 1-0 win for Kosovo. Lithuania might score but probably not.

<strong>Kosovo vs. Romania:</strong> I believe Kosovo are going to perform very well and beat Romania 2-0.

<strong>Lithuania vs. Cyprus:</strong> This game should be a draw with both teams playing very averagely. 0-0.

<strong>Cyprus vs. Romania:</strong> Romania will dominate again, 3-0 win.

<strong>Kosovo vs. Lithuania:</strong> Kosovo are the better team and should destroy lithuania 5-0.

<strong>Cyprus vs. Kosovo:</strong> The most likely outcome is a 1-1 draw.

<strong>Lithuania vs. Romania:</strong> Romania might struggle but will pull out a 2-1 win.</div>
