  <h1>Description for code_2025-05-15_2W3FZPR.html</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The game, as it is coded, is unwinnable. There is no winning ending. All paths ultimately lead to "ending_failure".

Here's a breakdown of why and how:

1.  <strong>The Game's Premise:</strong> The game is about the frustrating process of trying to get a modpack working. The narrative leans heavily into the common experiences of encountering errors, trying fixes, and ultimately failing.

2.  <strong>No Success Condition:</strong> There is no <code>ending_success</code> or similar scene defined in the <code>gameData.scenes</code> object. There's no coded pathway to a "win" state.

3.  <strong>Linearity of Failure:</strong> While there are choices, they are designed to lead down a rabbit hole of increasingly frustrating and convoluted attempts to fix the problem. The options often loop back to checking logs or searching forums, which then lead to more obscure "fixes" that ultimately fail.

4.  <strong>The <code>ending_failure</code> State:</strong> The <code>ending_failure</code> scene is hardcoded as the destination for the story. It's a deliberate design choice to reflect the often-unsuccessful reality of troubleshooting complex modpacks.

<strong>In short: the game's narrative structure and lack of a success condition make it impossible to win as the code currently exists.</strong> You are meant to experience the frustration and inevitable defeat.</div>
