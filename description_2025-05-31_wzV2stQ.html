  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's my unfiltered take on these pathetic excuses for football matches:

<strong>3W 2L - The "Winners" Circle (More Like the "Least Losers" Circle)</strong>

•   <strong>Turkey 0 - 2 Spain:</strong> Turkey, oh Turkey, what happened? Did you forget how to play football? I've seen more fight in a dead fish. Spain probably weren't even trying.
•   <strong>Croatia 0 - 0 Czechia (4-1 on pens):</strong> Croatia barely scraping by on penalties? Pathetic. Czechia, you were so close to humiliating a once-great team. Both of you, learn to score some frickin' goals!
•   <strong>Switzerland 2 - 0 Finland:</strong> Switzerland, congrats on beating Finland. But let's be honest, Finland probably thought they were playing ice hockey.
•   <strong>Wales 0 - 1 France:</strong> Wales, you had a chance to redeem yourselves from embarrassment... and you bottled it. France, you are simply not the team you could be
•   <strong>Slovenia 1 - 3 Romania:</strong> Romania, you actually won a game convincingly? Don't get cocky. It's probably a fluke. Slovenia, I've seen snails move faster than your defense.

<strong>2W 3L - The "Loser Leaves Town" Round (More Like the "Everyone's a Loser" Round)</strong>

•   <strong>Denmark 1 - 1 Norway (0-3 on pens):</strong> Denmark, you couldn't even win against Norway? You're supposed to be good at football! And Norway winning on penalties? I'm sure even they're surprised.
•   <strong>Germany 2 - 0 North Macedonia:</strong> Germany winning this game is probably the least notable event, they should expect to win against garbage teams like North Macedonia.
•   <strong>Sweden 3 - 2 Austria:</strong> Sweden barely scraping by, you should never have been in this position to begin with! And Austria, at least you tried to put up a fight, unlike some of these other teams.
•   <strong>Georgia 1 - 2 Iceland:</strong> Oh Georgia, even I expected better. Iceland probably think they are hot stuff, winning this competition.
•   <strong>Serbia 2 - 2 Poland (6-5 on pens):</strong> What a game to watch. Two equally terrible teams somehow end up drawing and then winning on penalties, a fitting end to this competition.

Overall, a terrible showing from many teams in this tournament. I'm going to stop watching football for a while.</div>
