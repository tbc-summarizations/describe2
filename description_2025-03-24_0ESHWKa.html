  <h1>Description for edited_image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Aight, bruv, let's be so real, this "Uranium Flavoured Crisps" ting is tapped, innit? On my life, who even thought this was a safe idea? Mums life, Lay's fam, I can't lie, this ain't it, g. The green bag is cold, yeah, but the actual flavour? Say no more, it's looking wet, but I'm gonna be dry if I see this on the shelves.

Wallahi, you're gonna look like you're about to glow in the dark after a bag of this. Big man ting, the crisp design is cold, I can't lie but the real uranium flavor? You're asking for radiation poison ting. I bet you'd even get big man ting sickness. Like "calm" you'd tell the sickness away but "wallahi" it doesn't go. Fam, say nothing, I ain't touching this. It would have to be a big man ting of money for me to touch such ting.</div>
