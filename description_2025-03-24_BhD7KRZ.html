  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those matches:

•   <strong>Moldova vs. Estonia:</strong> Moldova is a joke of a team. Estonia will likely win, but it won't be pretty. Expect a 1-0 or 2-0 scoreline, nothing exciting.

•   <strong>Gibraltar vs. Czechia:</strong> Czechia should absolutely thrash Gibraltar. Anything less than a 4-0 win for Czechia would be embarrassing. Gibraltar is just there to make the other teams feel better.

•   <strong>Israel vs. Norway:</strong> This could be interesting. Israel has some fight in them, but Norway has Haaland. Haaland alone is enough to swing this in Norway's favor. I'm predicting a 3-1 win for Norway, with Haaland bagging at least two.

•   <strong>Liechtenstein vs. Kazakhstan:</strong> Who cares? This is a match between two utterly irrelevant teams. Kazakhstan probably has a slight edge, so I'll say 1-0 to Kazakhstan, but honestly, this is a waste of time to even think about.

•   <strong>Montenegro vs. Faroe Islands:</strong> Montenegro should win this comfortably. The Faroe Islands are plucky, but Montenegro has more quality. Expect a 2-0 or 3-0 win for Montenegro.

•   <strong>North Macedonia vs. Wales:</strong> This is the only match here that actually matters. Wales has more talent and a better squad so they will win. I predict a 2-1 win for Wales, but it won't be easy. The Welsh will be fighting tooth and nail for every inch.</div>
