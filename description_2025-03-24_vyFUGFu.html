  <div class="discord-text">England, despite winning 4-0, started the match like a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who thought they could stroll into Kazakhstan and pick up an easy win. They were lucky Terry made that early block, because otherwise, they would have been in deep trouble. The fact that Capello even had to mention their sluggish start shows how unprepared they were.

Kazakhstan, on the other hand, showed some early grit and passion. They made England sweat for a bit. But let's be honest, that's all they had. Once England scored, their energy just evaporated. They folded like cheap origami. That disallowed goal probably crushed their spirit, but they were never going to sustain that level of intensity for 90 minutes.

In the end, England's individual brilliance, like Rooney's overhead kick, was enough to secure the win. But it was far from a convincing performance. They were playing against Kazakhstan, not a top-tier team. If they play like that against tougher opponents, they'll be torn apart.

Kazakhstan's fans were great, though. They deserve credit for creating an atmosphere. It's just a shame their team couldn't match their enthusiasm.</div>
