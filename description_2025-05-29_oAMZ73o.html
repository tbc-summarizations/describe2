  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to sting.

•   <strong>Real Madrid vs. Bayern Munich:</strong> Well, well, well. Look who choked. Real Madrid, the supposed kings of Europe, getting outplayed by a German machine. Can't rely on refereeing decisions to win you every game, can you? Maybe next time, score more than one goal over two legs. Embarrassing.

•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund vs. Feyenoord:</strong> Dortmund, what a disaster. Getting absolutely battered by Feyenoord. Serves them right for thinking they could just waltz into the Champions League and expect a free pass. Rotterdam is partying tonight, and Dortmund is probably crying into their bratwurst.

•   <strong>Manchester United vs. Liverpool:</strong> Typical Manchester United. Spending millions and still getting humiliated by their rivals. Liverpool didn't even have to break a sweat. Maybe try investing in some actual talent instead of relying on past glory. At this point, even Everton would be a challenge for them.

•   <strong>Benfica vs. Marseille:</strong> Benfica bottled it. Giving up a lead at home, only to get spanked in France? Pathetic. Marseille showed them how it's done, playing with passion and actually wanting to win. Benfica can go back to their Primeira Liga and cry about it.

In summary, some of these teams deserve to be laughed out of Europe. What a joke.</div>
