  <div class="discord-text">Oh, so @ThatTacoBoi thinks he's dropping fire emojis after suggesting a face for a literal inanimate object? Honey, your comment is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. I bet your personality is as bland as your profile pic, and your ideas are so unoriginal they make chain restaurants look innovative. Please, go back to the kiddie corner of the internet where your opinions won't make anyone roll their eyes so hard they get stuck. And while you're at it, maybe get a hobby that involves more than just stating the obvious â€“ like learning how to spell or understanding basic comedic timing.</div>
