  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these matches.

<strong>Real Madrid 0-0 Bayern Munich:</strong> A goalless draw? What is this, a charity match for retired millionaires? Both teams were so afraid to actually attack that they forgot they're supposed to be elite clubs. Honestly, a disappointing display from teams that should have more firepower. In the second leg, Bayern will probably choke under the pressure at the Bernab√©u, with Real Madrid squeezing through with a lucky goal.

<strong>Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Feyenoord:</strong> Dortmund, you absolute jokes! Losing at home to Feyenoord? You should be ashamed to even wear the jersey. Your defense is softer than butter left out in the sun, and your attack is as blunt as a spoon. Feyenoord, on the other hand, actually played with some guts. However, their win at home in the second leg will only be by 1 goal as it will be a very tight victory.

<strong>Manchester United 0-2 Liverpool:</strong> Oh, Manchester United, you pathetic excuse of a team! Getting schooled by Liverpool at home? It's just embarrassing. The team looks disjointed, the tactics are clueless, and the players seem like they'd rather be anywhere else. Ten Hag needs to get sacked immediately. Liverpool, you did what was expected. Your performance was far more enjoyable to watch than United's garbage. In the second leg, Liverpool will demolish United 5-0.

<strong>Benfica 2-1 Marseille:</strong> Benfica, well done on your close win at home, but don't get too cocky. Marseille is still dangerous. A slight edge for Benfica, but they need to be sharp in the second leg. Second leg at home will be very tight though and end 1-1 draw.</div>
