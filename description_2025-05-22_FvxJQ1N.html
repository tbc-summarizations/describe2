  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal and honest assessment of this XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Lukasz Skorupski:</strong> 6 - A decent, but not spectacular, goalkeeper. Reliable, but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Ermin Bicakcic:</strong> 5 - Past his prime. Lack of pace and prone to errors.
•   <strong>Jan Bednarek:</strong> 6.5 - Can be solid on his day, but inconsistent. Not a top-tier defender.
•   <strong>Bartosz Bereszynski:</strong> 6 - A hardworking but unspectacular player. Does his job, but offers little creativity or attacking threat.
•   <strong>Matty Cash:</strong> 7 - A decent right-back with good energy and some attacking ability.
•   <strong>Viktor Tsyhankov:</strong> 7.5 - A technically gifted player with good vision and a goal threat.
•   <strong>Piotr Zielinski:</strong> 7 - A talented midfielder with good passing range and dribbling skills. Can be inconsistent and lacks physicality.
•   <strong>Anton Miranchuk:</strong> 6.5 - A decent playmaker with a good eye for a pass.
•   <strong>Anastasios Bakasetas:</strong> 6 - A solid midfielder with a good work rate.
•   <strong>Robert Lewandowski:</strong> 9 - A world-class striker. Clinical finisher and a major threat to any defense.
•   <strong>Artem Dzyuba:</strong> 6 - A physical striker who can be a handful for defenders.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>Overall: 6.2/10</strong>

This team has a good striker in Lewandowski, a few solid midfielders and some shaky defense. The defensive line is a clear weakness, lacking pace and top-tier quality. The midfield is decent, but lacks a true world-class presence. Overall, this team would struggle against top opposition.</div>
