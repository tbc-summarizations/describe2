  <div class="discord-text">Darth Vader would be conflicted. On one hand, he desires to overthrow the Emperor and rule the galaxy himself, so seeing Luke defeated is a step towards that goal. On the other hand, he is Luke's father and a part of him wants to protect his son, even if he believes the dark side is the only way. Ultimately, Vader would likely see this as a necessary step in Luke's path towards becoming a powerful Sith Lord. He's a manipulator, so he'd use this event to further his own agenda.</div>
