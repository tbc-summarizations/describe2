  <h1>Description for IMG_9327.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, you want a roast, you got it. Buckle up because there's nothing to roast here except a whole lotta nothingness. 

This image is so bland, it's like the visual equivalent of unseasoned tofu. It's the void after you drop your phone down the toilet. This picture is so black, it makes Vantablack look like a rainbow. It's the kind of image that makes you question why you even bothered opening it. You could stare into this abyss for hours, and all you'd get is a headache and a profound sense of disappointment. 

I hope you enjoyed getting your time wasted.</div>
