  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-4sU-aB9prmhS.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The 8th episode of Battle For Nitrous doesn't have an elimination. The contestants are told to gift Al Gore something and he will rate it out of 10.

Some of the gifts were good gifts like a birthday cake or strawberries, but most gifts were just to kill or troll Al Gore. The gifts that were supposed to kill Al Gore received a 0/10 rating while the gifts that were unique got higher ratings.

Steak, one of the contestants, just gifted Al Gore some money and Al Gore rated it a 10/10 so he wins. He asks to give the other contestants a voice, which Al Gore agrees to.

The episode concludes with the past contestants asking for a chance to rejoin the game and the viewers get to vote for who comes back.</div>
