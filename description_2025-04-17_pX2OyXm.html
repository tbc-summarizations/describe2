  <div class="discord-text">Alright, hereâ€™s a harsh assessment of the Coconut Elephant character from this bizarre object show:

<strong>Essay on Coconut Elephant</strong>

<strong>General Information:</strong>

This freak of nature is called Coconut Elephant. I don't know who thought this up but it is absurd and is on some serious drugs. The character participates in challenges as we see at \[00:48] as he is jumping into the grey gap. I really don't like this show because I don't think that any of these characters are good.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

The Coconut Elephant is the most grotesque thing I've ever seen. It's literally a whole elephant with a coconut replacing its ass. It is an elephant so the color is grey and has a big long trunk. The legs and feet are an elephants with the back having an elephant butt that is replaced with a coconut. The coconut is white and looks nasty with coconut hairs.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

From what I can tell, the Coconut Elephant seems like a confident idiot. He said in \[00:48] this is easy as he's falling. Dude, how can you not tell this is a hole? Just because its easy to do so doesn't mean you can make it out alive. Dude is gonna fail.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

His only ability seems to be falling into holes and screaming about how easy it is. That's literally it. He's got zero skills and is a complete liability. I also think his ability is to break into pieces.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Coconut Elephant gets a 0/10. This character is disgusting, useless, and a burden to everyone involved in this travesty of a show. He needs to be eliminated immediately and the writers of this show should seriously reconsider their life choices.</div>
