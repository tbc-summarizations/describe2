  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to be a bloodbath. Here's the brutally honest take on who makes it out of these groups and why, based on current form, tactical strengths, and sheer ruthlessness:

<strong>Group A: The "Overhyped vs. Inconsistent" Showdown</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> They're the favorites for a reason. Mbappé is still a cheat code, and they have the midfield depth to control games. However, complacency is their biggest enemy. If they show up hungry, they top this group. If not, they'll be scrambling.
•   <strong>England:</strong> Southgate is the master of underperforming. This team has talent oozing from every pore, but their tactical rigidity will be their downfall. Expect them to grind out some ugly wins, but ultimately fall short of their potential. They'll likely scrape through in second place.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> They're a shadow of their former selves. They lack a true goalscorer and their midfield isn't as dominant as it once was. Expect them to struggle against the stronger teams in the group and maybe they won't go to next stage
•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> They're the dark horse, capable of causing an upset if they click. They have a solid defense and a creative midfield, but their attack is too reliant on individuals. They'll fight hard, but ultimately lack the firepower to advance.

<strong>Group B: The "Group of Death" Grinder</strong>

•   <strong>Germany:</strong> They're back, baby! Flick has restored some order and their midfield is a force to be reckoned with. Their biggest weakness is at striker, but they have enough firepower to overcome that. They'll top this group with ruthless efficiency.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> Ronaldo is still a goal machine, but they're too reliant on him. They have a talented squad, but their defense is suspect and their midfield lacks bite. Expect them to struggle against the stronger teams and potentially crash out early.
•   <strong>Italy:</strong> The reigning champions are a pale imitation of their former selves. They lack creativity in midfield and their attack is toothless. They'll struggle to score goals and their defense is no longer as solid as it once was. Expect them to be eliminated in the group stage.
•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> They're a team in decline. Their golden generation is aging and their defense is creaking. They still have some talented players, but they lack the cohesion and intensity to compete with the top teams. Expect them to struggle and potentially finish bottom of the group.

<strong>Group C: The "Mid-Table Mayhem"</strong>

•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> They're a team of veterans who know how to grind out results. Modrić is still a magician in midfield, but their attack lacks firepower. Expect them to be solid and well-organized, but ultimately fall short of the top teams.
•   <strong>Denmark:</strong> They're a well-balanced team with a strong work ethic. Their midfield is creative and their attack is clinical. They're capable of causing an upset if they catch a team off guard.
•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> They're a solid and well-organized team, but they lack the firepower to compete with the top teams. They'll be difficult to beat, but ultimately lack the quality to advance.
•   <strong>Austria:</strong> They're a team in transition. They have some talented young players, but they lack the experience and cohesion to compete at this level. Expect them to struggle and finish bottom of the group.

<strong>Group D: The "Eastern European Underdogs"</strong>

•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> They're a passionate and well-supported team. Their midfield is creative and their attack is dangerous. They're capable of causing an upset if they catch a team off guard.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> They're a team with a strong work ethic and a never-say-die attitude. Their midfield is solid and their defense is well-organized. They'll be difficult to beat.
•   <strong>Sweden:</strong> They're a team in transition. Ibrahimović is gone and their attack lacks firepower. Their defense is solid, but they lack the creativity to score goals. Expect them to struggle and finish bottom of the group.
•   <strong>Wales:</strong> They're a team of overachievers who rely on their team spirit and determination. Bale is still a threat, but he's no longer the player he once was. Expect them to struggle against the stronger teams and potentially finish bottom of the group.</div>
