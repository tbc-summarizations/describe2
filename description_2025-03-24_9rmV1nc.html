  <div class="discord-text">Okay, imagine your toy car gets really hot when you play with it for too long, especially when it's plugged into a charger, right?

Well, this setting is like telling your toy car, "Hey, when you're playing a game and plugged into a super-fast charger that's really strong (25W or more), and your battery is already a little full (over 20%), don't charge the battery directly. Instead, use the charger's power to run the game, so your battery doesn't get too hot!"

So, it stops the battery from getting too hot by not making it work so hard while you're playing. Makes sense?</div>
