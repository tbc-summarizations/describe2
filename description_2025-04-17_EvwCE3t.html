<strong>Essay: Evil Venus, a Disgusting Contender</strong>

Evil Venus is an edgy character in the object show, and honestly, I don't get what the point of its existence is. It's a cringy attempt to be edgy and 'cool', but it just comes off as try-hard and pathetic.

<strong>General Information:</strong>

As an object show contestant, Evil Venus's goal is simple: to win. But its methods are questionable at best. It's unclear what show this character comes from, but it doesn't matter.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Evil Venus is a black screen with a yellow sponge, two guns, a knife and skull emoji. The appearance screams 'I'm trying to be cool and intimidating'. This garbage design is just disgusting.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Evil Venus is an aggressive, confrontational character that tries to hard to be edgy. His personality is insufferable.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

Apparently, Evil Venus is capable of blowing nuclear weapons. This ability doesn't make the character any more likable; it just makes them a dangerous idiot.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Overall, Evil Venus is a terrible character that should be eliminated immediately. The character is edgy, and the execution is lazy and obnoxious. A 1/10.</div>
