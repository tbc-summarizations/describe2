  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of this XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Unai Simon (Spain): 6/10 - Capable of brilliance, but prone to errors. Not someone I'd rely on in a high-stakes match.
•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Duje Caleta-Car (Croatia): 5/10 - Physically imposing, but lacks agility and can be slow to react. A liability against pacey attackers.
•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Dani Carvajal (Spain): 7/10 - Experienced and reliable, but his best years are behind him. Can still contribute defensively.
•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Aymeric Laporte (Spain): 6/10 - Decent in possession, but his defensive positioning and tackling can be questionable.
•   <strong>Defender:</strong> Nacho (Spain): 6/10 - A versatile squad player, but not a top-tier defender. Lacks the pace and strength to dominate.
•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Mateo Kovacic (Croatia): 7/10 - A skillful dribbler and passer, but lacks a consistent end product. Can be wasteful in key areas.
•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Fabian Ruiz (Spain): 6/10 - A technically gifted player, but often lacks the physicality and intensity to control midfield battles.
•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Dani Olmo (Spain): 7/10 - Creative and versatile, but can be inconsistent. Needs to add more goals and assists to his game.
•   <strong>Midfielder:</strong> Davide Frattesi (Italy): 6/10 - A promising young player, but still raw and unproven at the highest level.
•   <strong>Attacker:</strong> Giacomo Raspadori (Italy): 6/10 - A talented forward with good movement, but lacks the physical presence and finishing ability to be a top striker.
•   <strong>Attacker:</strong> Ferran Torres (Spain): 5/10 - A frustrating player to watch. Has moments of brilliance, but lacks consistency and often makes poor decisions.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>Overall: 5/10</strong>

This team is a mess, to be frank. It lacks a clear identity, a strong spine, and a reliable goalscorer. The defense is shaky, the midfield lacks steel, and the attack is toothless. This is a team that would struggle to compete against top opposition and would likely be easily exposed by more organized and clinical sides. They'd get demolished.</div>
