  <div class="discord-text">Safe, fam. On my life, this "Blonde Don" is moving mad, innit? I can't lie, this tweet is tapped. Saying you wish 13, 14, 15-year-old girls weren't hot so you wouldn't feel like a creeper? Bruv, that's cold. Like, wallahi, you're supposed to be a big man, but you're sounding proper wet right now. Man's trying to play it calm by saying "I'm still 19," but that just makes it worse, g. Say nothing; this whole ting is just dry.

Ill be so real, there's nothing safe about this big man ting. A dry situation for sure, I'm gonna be on the block, I cannot lie. You've tapped to the situation. Its not cold. I feel wet saying this wallahi. Mums life to me fam, big man has tapped this ting. The people are gonna be tapped and gonna be wet to the situation. I am not really sure I understand the sitch you have put me into for this situation. Say no more, but its on my mums life, its not cool!</div>
