  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pathetic excuse for a Champions League final.

<strong>Fulham:</strong> You dominated possession, ran like headless chickens for more distance, and managed to get off a whopping 21 shots! Congrats on the effort, but you're so offensively incompetent that only 12 troubled the keeper and zero hit the back of the net in regular time. You are a prime example of how useless statistics can be when you choke under pressure. Enjoy your shiny possession trophy while AZ is off celebrating the actual trophy.

<strong>AZ:</strong> Oh, AZ, you bunch of Dutch donkeys. You had a measly 4 shots and didn't even bother aiming them at the goal. Your passing was so bad it looked like you were trying to play keep-away with the other team. You were outrun, out-passed, and generally outplayed. But you know what? You somehow managed to win anyway. Congratulations on the ultimate heist; it just goes to show that sometimes all it takes is a little bit of luck and a whole lot of ineptitude from your opponent to become a champion.

In short, this match was a masterclass in mediocrity. Both teams should be ashamed of their performance, but AZ gets a pass because they at least had the decency to win. Fulham, on the other hand, can go back to London and cry into their tea.
