  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A TV FROM THE STONE AGE? PRUH, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING MY GRANDPARENTS USED TO WATCH LAWRENCE WELK ON, BUT EVEN THEY UPGRADED TO A FLAT SCREEN IN '98! LOOK AT THOSE SHITTY ANTENNAS, THEY PROBABLY GET BETTER RECEPTION WITH A COAT HANGER AND SOME TIN FOIL!

AND THE "FLY!!" ON THE SCREEN? GRUH, IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE IMPRESSIVE? IT LOOKS LIKE A FAILED ATTEMPT AT GRAFFITI BY A MIDDLE SCHOOL KID WHO JUST DISCOVERED THROWIES. I BET THE ONLY THING THAT TV CAN FLY TO IS THE NEAREST LANDFILL. CUH, IT'S TRASH.

AND THE BACKGROUND WITH ALL THE BINARY CODE? OMAGUH, ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SCARED OF A HACKER NOW? ZUH, ANY SCRIPT KIDDY WITH A TOR BROWSER COULD DO BETTER THAN THAT. IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE JUST COPIED AND PASTED THE MATRIX SCREEN SAVER.

AND "HACKED BY..."? LUH, ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHO EVEN USES THAT PHRASE ANYMORE? IT'S SO 2000S, IT'S EMBARRASSING. I BET IT WAS HACKED BY SOME 12-YEAR-OLD GOONIN IN HIS MOM'S BASEMENT WHO THINKS HE'S THE NEXT ANONYMOUS.

THIS WHOLE THING IS A JOKE. IT'S LIKE SOMEONE TOOK ALL THE WORST CLICHÃ‰S FROM HACKER MOVIES AND THREW THEM INTO A BLENDER. OMAGUH, I'M OFFENDED THAT SOMEONE EVEN THOUGHT THIS WAS WORTH CREATING. IT'S AN INSULT TO HACKERS, TO TELEVISIONS, AND TO ART ITSELF.

THIS IS SO BAD, IT MAKES ME WANT TO GO BACK TO AOL DIAL-UP. AT LEAST BACK THEN, THINGS WERE HONESTLY SHITTY. THIS IS JUST PRETENTIOUSLY SHITTY.

AND THAT RED GLOW AROUND EVERYTHING? ARE WE IN A HACKER'S LAIR OR A CHEAP NIGHTCLUB? IT'S LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO DISTRACT US FROM HOW AWFUL EVERYTHING ELSE IS.

I HAD A BUDDY, A REAL HACKER, ONCE TOLD ME THAT THE BEST HACKS ARE THE ONES YOU DON'T SEE COMING. WELL, I SAW THIS GARBAGE FIRE COMING A MILE AWAY.

THIS IMAGE IS TRASH. IT'S WORSE THAN RECEIVING A SPAM EMAIL FROM A NIGERIAN PRINCE. IT'S LIKE STEPPING IN DOG SHIT ON A HOT SUMMER DAY. IT'S A CULINARY SHIT SHOW. JUST THROW THE WHOLE THING AWAY.</div>
