  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. No sugarcoating here.

•   <strong>Real Madrid vs. Young Boys: 8-1</strong>
    Real Madrid is a freaking machine in the Champions League. Young Boys, bless their hearts, will get steamrolled. 5-0 in Madrid, then Real cruises to a 3-1 win in Switzerland, teaching them a lesson in quality.

•   <strong>Fenerbahce vs. Bayern Munich: 2-7</strong>
    Fenerbahce will put up a fight in the first leg in Turkey, losing like 2-3 but Bayern are ruthless and will destroy them 4-0 in Germany. Fenerbahce's defense won't be able to handle Bayern's relentless attack.

•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund vs. Slavia Prague: 5-2</strong>
    Dortmund's attack is too explosive for Slavia to contain. A 3-0 win at home and then a comfortable 2-2 draw in Prague. Slavia will try to be creative, but they're going to get burned.

•   <strong>Feyenoord vs. Celtic: 3-4</strong>
    A tight match. A 2-1 win for Feyenoord in Rotterdam, but Celtic will dig deep and win 3-1 at home, fueled by their passionate fans. Feyenoord's going out with a whimper.

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain vs. Manchester United: 6-2</strong>
    PSG's attack is too much for United's shambolic defense. A 4-1 thumping in Paris and a 2-1 win at Old Trafford. United will look clueless, and their fans will be crying into their overpriced beers.

•   <strong>Barcelona vs. Liverpool: 3-4</strong>
    This will be war. A thrilling 2-2 draw at Camp Nou, and then Liverpool edges it 2-1 at Anfield. Barcelona's midfield will get overrun, and Liverpool's attack will be too hot to handle.

•   <strong>Benfica vs. Porto: 2-3</strong>
    An intense, dirty affair, but Porto are slightly better prepared. A 2-1 win for Benfica at home, but Porto wins 2-0 at the Dragão. Expect lots of fouls and at least one red card.

•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk vs. Marseille: 2-4</strong>
    Marseille will take them out and they will be playing dirty too. Marseille wins 3-1 at home and loses 1-0 away.

There you have it. Honest, brutal, and accurate. Don't come crying to me when these predictions come true.</div>
