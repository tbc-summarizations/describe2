  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this UCL final was a joke. West Ham, bless their pathetic hearts, showed up just to be spectators in their own humiliation. Eight shots? Three on target? That's the kind of offensive output you expect from a team that's already accepted defeat before kickoff. They ran around a lot, sure, covering more distance, probably because they spent most of the match chasing Valencia's shadows. 43% possession? They couldn't even hold onto the ball long enough to string together a coherent attack.

And Valencia, don't think you're getting off scot-free. One measly goal after 105 minutes? You call that a Champions League-winning performance? It took you extra time to scrape by against a team that barely belongs in the Europa League. You had more shots and more shots on target, which, against this West Ham side, is like bragging about winning a race against a toddler. Javi Guerra, congratulations on your late winner, but don't act like you carried the team; you just happened to be in the right place at the right time to exploit West Ham's perpetual incompetence.

In conclusion, this final was an insult to the beautiful game. Both teams should be ashamed of their lackluster performance. Valencia might have lifted the trophy, but they did so in the most underwhelming way possible. As for West Ham, well, they just proved they're still the same old West Ham.</div>
