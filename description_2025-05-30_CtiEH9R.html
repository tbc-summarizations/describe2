  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my unfiltered take on Matchday 2, roasting teams where deserved:

•   <strong>Switzerland vs. Germany (1-1):</strong> A tie? How boring. Switzerland, you're always just...there. Germany, expected better, maybe you guys need to invest in some real players, not just flashy names.
•   <strong>Turkey vs. Greece (4-4):</strong> A goal fest disasterclass. Defenses were on holiday, clearly. Both teams looked like they were allergic to defending, embarrassing display.
•   <strong>Austria vs. England (0-2):</strong> Austria couldn't score if their lives depended on it. England, you barely scraped by, don't get cocky. You played Austria, after all.
•   <strong>Netherlands vs. Ukraine (2-2):</strong> Another tie, yawn. Netherlands, you're supposed to be a footballing nation. Ukraine, surprise you even scored twice.
•   <strong>Belgium vs. France (1-0):</strong> Belgium, your golden generation is tarnishing. France, losing to Belgium? Pathetic. Where's the flair? The dominance? Overrated.
•   <strong>Poland vs. Czechia (2-1):</strong> Poland, congratulations on beating Czechia, who gives a damn? Neither of you will go far. Czechia, just go home.
•   <strong>Scotland vs. Italy (0-1):</strong> Scotland, you bottled it. Just like always. Italy, boring win, but a win's a win, I guess.
•   <strong>Portugal vs. Spain (0-0):</strong> A snooze-fest El Clásico. Ronaldo needs to get it together to actually score as the GOAT and Spain, you're still living off past glory. No one cares about tiki-taka anymore if you can't finish.</div>
