  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercups, because this video is a roast waiting to happen, and I'm your designated chef. Let's dive into this pixelated nightmare.

<strong>The Visuals:</strong>

•   First off, the animation style is so bad it makes MS Paint look like Pixar. It's like a toddler raided the recycling bin and decided to make a geopolitical statement.
•   The Illuminati triangle with its derpy, googly eye. Is that supposed to be menacing or just... constipated? It looks like it's struggling to pass a pyramid scheme.
•   The country flags that look like a Minecraft world went through a shredder. And they're all made of the same bland, lifeless squares? Is this supposed to be a budget-friendly UN?
•   Every character looks like they were designed by someone who vaguely remembers what shapes are. It's like a toddler raided the recycling bin and decided to make a geopolitical statement.
•   Transitions are as smooth as sandpaper on a chalkboard. Every jump cut feels like an assault on the eyes.

<strong>The Audio &amp; Narratives:</strong>

•   Oh lord, they "just" wanna kill people, the audio sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. I've heard better quality from a potato.
•   The rambling explanation about a show to compete for to become good boy. This is probably one of the most cringe-inducing things this video has shown.
•   The statement about Russia needing to be eliminated sounds like what my ex would say to me after I forgot to put the toilet seat down.
•   The speaker keeps saying things about all these countries such as ""oh, the real support that's going to happen" or ""this is my show" is a sad attempt at seeming deep and cool for what it truly is.
•   At the end there's a statement that things has to do a "fact check" and I hope that it doesn't pass otherwise what's the point?

<strong>Overall Impression:</strong>

This video is a clusterfuck of low-quality animation, and incoherent narratives. It's the kind of content that makes you question the meaning of existence, while simultaneously providing ample material for a ruthless roast.

Feel better, I'm sure someone out there loves this content with my roasting, but let's be real - this deserves to be memed.</div>
