  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal truth about UCL Matchday 8:

•   <strong>Aston Villa 4 - Celtic 2:</strong> Aston Villa, congrats on beating a team that barely qualifies as a professional football club. Celtic, go back to Scotland and try to win a league that matters to literally no one.

•   <strong>Leverkusen 2 - Sparta Prague 0:</strong> Leverkusen proves they can beat teams nobody cares about. Sparta Prague, just be glad you don't have to face a real opponent every week.

•   <strong>Dortmund 3 - Shakhtar 1:</strong> Dortmund scraping a win against a war-torn Shakhtar. Pathetic. You should be winning by a bigger margin.

•   <strong>Young Boys 0 - Red Star Belgrade 1:</strong> A game so boring, the only people watching were probably forced to. Congrats to Red Star for beating a team named after adolescent boys.

•   <strong>Barcelona 2 - Atalanta 2:</strong> Barcelona still trying to cling to past glories. Atalanta exposes them as the has-beens they are. Draw at home? Embarrassing.

•   <strong>Bayern 3 - Slovan Bratislava 1:</strong> Bayern barely breaking a sweat against a team that sounds like a knock-off cereal brand. Expected, boring, move on.

•   <strong>Inter 3 - Monaco 0:</strong> Inter showing some signs of life, but it's against Monaco, so who cares? Still living off their Champions League run.

•   <strong>Salzburg 1 - Atlético 4:</strong> Salzburg getting schooled by a real team. Atletico, good job beating the Austrian energy drink company.

•   <strong>Girona 1 - Arsenal 2:</strong> Girona thought they could play with the big boys? Arsenal, still proving they are just decent. Win only by 1 against Girona? Get better.

•   <strong>Dinamo Zagreb 2 - Milan 1:</strong> Milan getting upset by Dinamo Zagreb? A complete joke. Milan, time to pack it up and sell all your players as you're all finished.

•   <strong>Juventus 0 - Benfica 2:</strong> Juventus getting destroyed by Benfica. Good job Benfica, they're a disgrace to Italian football. What is going on?

•   <strong>Lille 6 - Feyenoord 1:</strong> Lille obliterating Feyenoord. Finally, someone with some flair. Feyenoord, that was a disgrace.

•   <strong>Man City 3 - Club Brugge 1:</strong> Man City cruising against Club Brugge, but we all know they'll choke in the knockout stages anyway. Overrated.

•   <strong>PSV 3 - Liverpool 2:</strong> Liverpool proving they're not the unbeatable force they once were. PSV stealing a win against a bigger club? That's cute. Liverpool's gonna be relegated soon.

•   <strong>Sturm Graz 1 - RB Leipzig 0:</strong> Leipzig choked. Who cares about Sturm Graz?

•   <strong>Sporting CP 1 - Bologna 1:</strong> A draw that's as exciting as watching paint dry. Both teams should be ashamed.

•   <strong>Brest 0 - Real Madrid 3:</strong> Real Madrid doing what they do best – winning ugly. Brest, good effort, but you're just a warm-up match.

•   <strong>Stuttgart 1 - PSG 4:</strong> PSG crushing Stuttgart. Money talks, but still boring to watch. Both teams are only good at beating up on weaker competition.

There you have it. Every team exposed for their true, pathetic selves.</div>
