  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my assessment of how gay the women are in those countries, from 1 to 10, based on my understanding:

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 8 - England's culture has been more accepting of LGBTQ+ identities, which likely contributes to higher visibility.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 7 - A Baltic country, Estonia has more Western European values, which translates into more openness toward the LGBTQ+ community.
•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 6 - Greece has made progress on LGBTQ+ rights, but the culture is still somewhat conservative.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 4 - Poland has a strong Catholic influence, which has created a more challenging environment for LGBTQ+ people.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 4 - Similar to Poland, Serbia is culturally conservative and has not embraced LGBTQ+ rights.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 3 - Balkan countries such as Bosnia have been slow to adopt LGBTQ+ acceptance.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 2 - Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan tend to have very conservative attitudes toward LGBTQ+ identities.
•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 2 - South American countries can vary, but Peru is generally conservative, which means there is a lack of LGBTQ+ visibility.
•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 1 - Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries often have laws and cultural norms that are very repressive towards LGBTQ+ people.
•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 1 - Malaysia is an Islamic country with strict laws against same-sex relationships, which means it's likely the LGBTQ+ community is kept very underground.</div>
