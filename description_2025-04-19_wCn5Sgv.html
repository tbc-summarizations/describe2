  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my ranking of all 38 characters from worst to best, based on their overall presence and impact in the videos:

<strong>Bottom Tier (These guys are just plain awful):</strong>

1.  <strong>Black Khan of Mongolia's Son:</strong> Absolutely pointless character. The little shits death only had one quick scene and then it immediately dies after this. Also he is just annoying as fuck and did not get any votes at all.
2. <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin:</strong> Had zero impact. Just a prop more than anything. Unnecessary and lame. Also ugly ass looking.
3. <strong>HenryTheKazakh:</strong> As pointless as humanly possible. He was a pillow dude, what he gonna do
4. <strong>Enrike21:</strong> Dude doesn't even say anything. Dude gets blown up for no reason so he can get blown up like ts just a fucking robot.

<strong>Meh Tier (Underwhelming and forgettable):</strong>

5.  <strong>Tennis Ball Bird:</strong> Pretty forgettable. Did that teleportation scene which was cool but really that's all he is

6.  <strong>SMB1 Luigi:</strong> A retro video game character with nothing going for him. Lacked any real personality or significance.
7. <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed?:</strong> At least they participated a bit, but they're just a YouTube thumbnail with legs. Not exactly memorable.
8. <strong>Coconut Elephant:</strong> Visually weird, but didn't really contribute anything meaningful to the story.
9. <strong>Gato De Naranjas:</strong> This random cat inside an orange just doesn't make sense or have any actual use.
10. <strong>Face:</strong> A lazy design that added nothing to the series. A simple smiley face, seriously?
11. <strong>Steak:</strong> Barely there, just a Minecraft block with legs. Lacked any real charm or purpose.
12. <strong>Al Gore:</strong> Just a photo of a politician. Doesn't fit with the other characters or add any real entertainment.
13. <strong>Plunger:</strong> Generic and forgettable, couldn't win even when his entire name is tied to winning.

<strong>Mid Tier (Had some moments, but nothing special):</strong>

14. <strong>IShowSpeed:</strong> Unfunny and obnoxious. Just a annoying streamer being annoying
15. <strong>Black Hole:</strong> Overrated and boring. Just sucks up shit and gets clowned on
16. <strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong> A team for sad losers. I think that is just an opinionated way to describe this boring character.
17. <strong>Rasmus HÃ¸jlund:</strong> He does say some lines of course, but not a fun character to have. His main feature is to be just a Danish speaker or whatever but his accent is like not funny.
18.  <strong>Goblin:</strong> At least had a slightly creepy aesthetic, but still not very interesting or well-developed. His face is also just ugly looking.

<strong>Upper Mid Tier (Decent characters with some redeeming qualities):</strong>

19. <strong>The Lion and The Small Dog When It Barks:</strong> Not gonna lie, the small dog is kinda funny, other than that eh. Not top tier for sure though.
20. <strong>Cold Cow:</strong> Okay design, I guess. But still not a ton to say. Also she just got clowned on in one of the episodes which was embarassing to see her lose so miserably.
21.  <strong>Stickman:</strong> At least a classic doodle, but ultimately bland and uninspired. He's so just a stickman dude.
22. <strong>Cow From Minecraft:</strong> A Minecraft cow with a blank expression, but the Minecraft thing gives it a slight edge.
23.  <strong>Evil Venus:</strong> Has a unique look and some slightly threatening energy, which is better than most here.
24. <strong>George W. Bush:</strong> A photo of Bush, like Al Gore, but slightly more amusing just because of his goofy face. Has also been used in good moments.

<strong>High Tier (Actually good and memorable characters):</strong>

25. <strong>AK-47:</strong> Not much to say other than dude's just iconic. Dude is mad though it is just kinda funny dude hates everyone 
26.  <strong>Benchodistan:</strong> Has some actual potential. Did well with his group and has good jokes.

<strong>Top Tier (The best of the best, genuinely entertaining):</strong>

27. <strong>Atomic Bomb:</strong> Surprisingly funny and cheerful for an atomic bomb. Brings a nice contrast.
28. <strong>HappyManOfficial Being Scary:</strong> Dude is insane but that adds to the comedy because when dude said "I will explode your home" that was an actual joke.
29.  <strong>Kamran Ibrahim Abdullah:</strong> He is a host for a reason. he knows how to make a good character even though he does need to get better backdrops for his shows, 
30. <strong>Uami Bosim:</strong> He is the one that did the elimination, so dude at least deserves some credit.

31-38. <strong>The Eliminated:</strong>
The eliminated are not ranked due to them being eliminated, it is not fair to compare them, due to us not seeing any of them.
