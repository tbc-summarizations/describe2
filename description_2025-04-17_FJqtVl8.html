  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-i0G-VgPfOuS0.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest breakdown of Goblin from this object show:

<strong>General Information</strong>

Goblin is an album, released in 2011 by Tyler, the Creator. It's not clear if he has other aliases, or if he is a human or some other object, but he has a very particular aesthetic and attitude.

<strong>External Appearance</strong>

Goblin is just the album cover of "Goblin". It's a black and white photo of a person with the word "GOBLIN" written in bold white letters. The cover is edgy, but it's nothing special. He has tiny, stumpy black limbs.

<strong>Personality</strong>

Goblin is angsty, aggressive, and frankly, kind of annoying. He's the type to whine about losing and act like he's the victim even when he's clearly the aggressor. There's a sense of entitlement and immaturity to his behavior, which is off-putting. He complains about how he should have won because he exploded a nuke...

<strong>Abilities</strong>

Apparently, Goblin's main ability is blowing up nuclear weapons. I guess. He has limbs and can manipulate with them objects as we saw him holding his own album cover.

<strong>Overall Rating</strong>

Goblin is trash. His personality is insufferable, his design is uninspired, and his actions are idiotic. The only good thing about him is that he was finally eliminated. 2/10. Would not recommend.</div>
