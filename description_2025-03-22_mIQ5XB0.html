  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the brutal truth as I see it:

•   <strong>Liechtenstein vs. North Macedonia 🇱🇮🇲🇰:</strong> North Macedonia will absolutely crush Liechtenstein. It's not even a question. Expect a scoreline of 4-0 or even worse for Liechtenstein. They're outmatched in every position.

•   <strong>Moldova vs. Norway 🇲🇩🇳🇴:</strong> Norway takes this comfortably. Haaland alone could probably outscore Moldova. I'm calling a 3-0 victory for Norway. Moldova will struggle to even get a shot on target.

•   <strong>Montenegro vs. Gibraltar 🇲🇪🇬🇮:</strong> Montenegro wins easily. Gibraltar is just not at the same level. I'm predicting a 5-0 thrashing. It could honestly be even more embarrassing for Gibraltar.

•   <strong>Czechia vs. Faroe Islands 🇨🇿🇫🇴:</strong> Czechia wins, but don't expect a cricket score. The Faroe Islands are surprisingly resilient defensively. I'll say 2-0 to Czechia.

•   <strong>Israel vs. Estonia 🇮🇱🇪🇪:</strong> This one is closer, but I'm leaning towards Israel. They have a bit more firepower upfront. A narrow 2-1 win for Israel.

•   <strong>Wales vs. Kazakhstan 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇰🇿:</strong> Wales should win this at home. Even without Bale, they have enough quality. 3-1 to Wales. Kazakhstan will put up a fight, but ultimately fall short.</div>
