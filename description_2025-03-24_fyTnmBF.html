  <div class="discord-text">Aight fam, lemme break it down for ya, wallahi. This clip is tapped, innit? Bloke's on the bus, proper veg situation, big man ting. The way he's shouting "If you're gonna take the underground then you're gay," on my life, that's cold. I can't lie, it's peak, bruv. Like, what's wrong with taking the underground? Is the ting too wet for him to go down there himself? Safe to say, some people are just chatting bare wasteman ting. Say no more.

Ill be so real, this reminds me of secondary school days, fam. When everyone was trying to be roadmen and chatting the most dry jokes, styll. Mums life, this ain't even funny; it's just a proper cringe moment on the bus. Safe to say this guy is probably like 16 and just doing it for the tiktok ting yeah. Bus vegs are now on a new level wallahi. The whole thing is just tapped, innit? Needs to calm down, G. Chatting bare wasteman stuff. Say nothing, say less.</div>
