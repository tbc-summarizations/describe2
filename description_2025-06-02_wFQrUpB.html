  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is going to sting.

<strong>England 2 - 3 Spain:</strong> England, always promising so much and delivering so little. They choked, plain and simple. Two goals against a powerhouse like Spain should be enough, but their defense crumbled like a cheap biscuit. Spain, on the other hand, showed why they're still a force to be reckoned with, even if their golden era is behind them.

<strong>France 3 - 0 Netherlands:</strong> France flexed their muscles and humiliated the Dutch. The Netherlands are clearly overrated and in a sad state. France is proving they're still a top contender.

<strong>Italy 1 - 0 Portugal:</strong> A snooze-fest of tactical fouling and cynical defending. Italy parked the bus and stole a win. Portugal, with all their supposed attacking talent, couldn't break down a well-organized defense. Pathetic.

<strong>Belgium 0 - 2 Germany:</strong> Belgium, another team that's been flattering to deceive for years. Their "golden generation" is tarnished, and they got outplayed by a resurgent Germany. Maybe it's time for Belgium to face the music and start rebuilding.

<strong>Denmark 0 - 3 Croatia:</strong> Denmark got absolutely dismantled by Croatia. They were completely outclassed, outthought, and outfought. Time for some serious soul-searching in the Danish camp.

<strong>Switzerland 4 - 4 Austria:</strong> An embarrassing defensive display from both sides. It was like watching two teams trying to outdo each other in terms of how many goals they could concede. At least it was entertaining, I guess?

<strong>Sweden 2 - 1 Ukraine:</strong> A scrappy, uninspired performance from both teams. Sweden somehow managed to edge out a win against an unconvincing Ukraine side. Don't expect either of these teams to go far.

<strong>Turkey 1 - 0 Wales:</strong> Turkey, playing with passion and determination, eked out a narrow victory against a lackluster Wales team. Wales showed little to no creativity and failed to convert that one goal, and let their country down.</div>
