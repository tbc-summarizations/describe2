  <h1>Description for IMG_8177.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Ayy, bruv, wallahi, look at this ting! On my life, that's a proper cold cat right there. Ill be so real, it's styll perched up like it owns the place, innit? Mums life, that face is tapped; it's got that 'say no more' vibe going on, g.

I can't lie, the way it's gripping onto the ledge with its paws is big man ting. Dry, but menacing. It's got that 'I'm about to drop a wet one' look, like it's contemplating causing some madness. The eyes are icy, fam, proper cold. It's a calm pose, but you know it's ready to pounce, say nothing. 

Overall, the cat is a certified top boy, holding court over the whole gaff. Safe.</div>
