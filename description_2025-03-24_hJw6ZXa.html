  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest prediction for the UEFA Euro 2024 Round of 16 matches:

•   <strong>Spain vs. Georgia:</strong> Spain will absolutely crush Georgia. The gap in quality is too vast. Georgia might put up a fight, but Spain's tactical superiority will be too much.

•   <strong>Germany vs. Denmark:</strong> Germany will likely win, but it won't be a cakewalk. Denmark is solid defensively and organized. The home advantage should be enough for Germany to scrape through.

•   <strong>Portugal vs. Slovenia:</strong> Portugal should win comfortably. Slovenia has been decent, but Portugal's offensive power is too much. Expect Ronaldo and Co. to dominate.

•   <strong>France vs. Belgium:</strong> This is a heavyweight clash. France has a stronger spine and better overall team structure. Belgium's golden generation is aging. France will edge this.

•   <strong>Romania vs. Netherlands:</strong> Netherlands to win, and it won't be close. Romania has been lucky to get this far. The Netherlands is far more talented.

•   <strong>Austria vs. Turkey:</strong> This is the toss-up of the round. Austria has been playing well but is less experienced. Turkey is unpredictable, but if they show up, they have the tools. Austria will likely outsmart them.

•   <strong>England vs. Slovakia:</strong> England should win this comfortably. Slovakia is weak compared to England's attacking quality.

•   <strong>Switzerland vs. Italy:</strong> Italy will win, but it will be ugly. Switzerland is a tough opponent, but Italy's defensive structure is elite. Expect a tactical, low-scoring affair with Italy just edging it.</div>
