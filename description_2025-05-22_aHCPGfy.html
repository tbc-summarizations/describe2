  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this lineup with brutal honesty:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Rui Patricio:</strong> 6. A decent shot-stopper but lacks the commanding presence and distribution skills of top-tier keepers.
•   <strong>Vladimir Coufal:</strong> 6.5. A solid, hard-working right-back, but nothing spectacular. Gets the job done.
•   <strong>Pepe:</strong> 7.5. Even in his twilight years, his experience and aggression are valuable, but his lack of pace is a liability.
•   <strong>Joao Cancelo:</strong> 8. A world-class full-back who can contribute in attack and defense. A clear standout.
•   <strong>Caglar Soyuncu:</strong> 5.5. A shaky defender who is prone to errors. Not reliable enough.
•   <strong>Tomas Soucek:</strong> 7. A physical midfielder who is good in the air and can score goals. Provides a useful presence.
•   <strong>Joao Palhinha:</strong> 7. A tough-tackling defensive midfielder who breaks up play effectively. Not much of a creative force, though.
•   <strong>Bernardo Silva:</strong> 8.5. A technically gifted and versatile player who can create chances and score goals. One of the team's best.
•   <strong>Danilo Pereira:</strong> 6.5. A defensive midfielder who offers protection to the backline but is limited in his passing range.
•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong> 9. Even past his peak, his goal-scoring ability and presence are undeniable. Still a threat.
•   <strong>Cenk Tosun:</strong> 4.5. A limited striker who lacks the quality to lead the line for a top team. A weak link.

<strong>Team Rating (out of 10):</strong>

<strong>6.5.</strong> This team is a mixed bag. It has some world-class players like Cancelo and Bernardo Silva, and Ronaldo's goal-scoring is always an asset. However, the defense is shaky, especially with Soyuncu, and Tosun is a liability upfront. The midfield is decent but lacks creativity beyond Bernardo Silva. Overall, it's a team with potential but too many weaknesses to be considered truly top-tier.</div>
