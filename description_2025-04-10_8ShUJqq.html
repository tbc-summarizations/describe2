  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dive into this lineup, from worst to best, based purely on my assessment:

1.  <strong>Apple:</strong> Completely unfunny. Just a ripoff from that fruit company nobody wants to deal with, like that guy thinks he's a top tier creator, how lame
2.  <strong>PLEASEUN_BANHENRY:</strong> Generic Roblox head, doesn’t bring anything unique to the table. His personality is lame and boring.
3.  <strong>Emoji:</strong> Predictable humor and low effort.
4.  <strong>Stickman:</strong> Basic drawing, I just could never laugh at this one for the personality that’s lacking. 
5.  <strong>Venus:</strong> Cringy and lame, you will be made fun of for this pick as well.
6.  <strong>United Airlines Flight 93:</strong> I mean the only thing it brings to the table is trauma.
7.  <strong>Neshtek:</strong> Some random pigeon, at least its personality makes sense.
8.  <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy:</strong> At least it brings something funny with its accent to the table. I still wouldn’t give him a high ranking tho
9.  <strong>Agar.io:</strong> A little more than just your run of the mill character, I guess its funny enough.
10. <strong>Meethexep:</strong> I do like the furries.
11. <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> It is the greatest country in the world.

There you have it. Brutally honest, just how you asked for it.</div>
