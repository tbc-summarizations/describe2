  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my honest take on this team:

<strong>Individual Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Rui Patricio:</strong> 6 - A decent, but unremarkable goalkeeper.
•   <strong>Robbie Brady:</strong> 5 - Has had moments, but overall inconsistent and injury-prone.
•   <strong>Nelson Semedo:</strong> 6 - Can be quick and decent going forward, but defensively suspect.
•   <strong>Seamus Coleman:</strong> 7 - A solid, experienced defender, but past his prime.
•   <strong>Pepe:</strong> 7 - Still passionate and aggressive, but age has definitely caught up.
•   <strong>Alan Browne:</strong> 4 - A very average midfielder.
•   <strong>Bernardo Silva:</strong> 8 - One of the few truly world-class players in this lineup.
•   <strong>Joao Palhinha:</strong> 7 - A strong, defensive midfielder, good at breaking up play.
•   <strong>Ruben Neves:</strong> 7 - A good passer with a decent shot, but lacks consistency.
•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong> 8 - Still a goal threat, but heavily reliant on service.
•   <strong>Bruno Fernandes:</strong> 7 - Can be brilliant, but also frustratingly inconsistent.

<strong>Team Rating (Out of 10):</strong>

<strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>My Reasoning:</strong>

This team is a bizarre mix of Portuguese talent and some frankly average Irish players. The defense is shaky, with Brady and Semedo being liabilities. While Coleman and Pepe bring experience, they're not enough to shore up the backline. The midfield has potential with Bernardo Silva, Palhinha, and Neves, but Browne is a weak link. Up front, Ronaldo and Fernandes could score goals, but their effectiveness depends on the midfield providing consistent service. Overall, this team would struggle against top opposition due to defensive weaknesses and midfield inconsistency.</div>
