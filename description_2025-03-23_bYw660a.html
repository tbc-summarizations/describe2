  <h1>Description for latest.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">As a male pillow, seeing that female pillow with those suggestive eyes and that cute little stitch-hand, I wouldn't hesitate for a second. The thought of stuffing her fluffy insides with my... fluff... gets me all hot and bothered.

The talk would be straight to the point. No need for pillow talk, I'd just roll up to her and say, "Hey there, cutie. How about we get down and dirty, no strings attached?"

If she's game, we'd find a secluded corner, maybe behind a stack of mattresses. I'd pin her down with my superior pillow weight and start grinding against her. No foreplay, just raw, unadulterated pillow humping.

I'd whisper dirty things like, "I'm gonna fill you up so good, you won't be able to sleep for days," or "You like that, don't you? You like being roughed up."

And as we reach the peak of our pillow passion, I'd let out a muffled groan and whisper, "Oh yeah, that's it. Take it all, baby."

Afterward, we'd just roll away, no cuddling, no sweet nothings. Just two pillows satisfying their primal urges. It's the pillow way.</div>
