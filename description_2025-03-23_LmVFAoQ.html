  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">These matches are surprisingly unrealistic and nonsensical for several reasons:

•   <strong>Croatia Dominating France:</strong> The first leg result of Croatia 2-0 France is highly improbable. Historically, France has been the stronger team, and for Croatia to win so decisively is very unexpected.

•   <strong>Denmark Beating Portugal:</strong> While Denmark is a decent team, a 1-0 victory over Portugal, especially given Portugal's attacking talent, is surprising. Portugal is expected to win or at least draw against Denmark.

•   <strong>Germany Losing to Italy and drawing with them too:</strong> Germany losing 1-2 to Italy is somewhat surprising. The second leg being a 3-3 draw is more plausible but still, this rivalry usually brings out tight and tactical games, not high-scoring thrillers like that.

•   <strong>Penalty Shootout Wins:</strong> Two penalty shootout results, France winning against Croatia and Spain winning against Netherlands, seem a bit too convenient to engineer more drama. It makes the overall set of matches even more ridiculous, as one leg of the France-Croatia was also not very realistic.

•   <strong>High-Scoring Draws:</strong> Both legs between Netherlands and Spain ending in high-scoring draws is unlikely. Usually, one of these teams would be able to win a match more often.

In short, the outcomes feel forced and not reflective of the true capabilities and historical performances of these teams.</div>
