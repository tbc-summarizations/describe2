  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest rating of each server icon from 1 to 10:

1.  <strong>Garfield:</strong> 2/10. It's low-effort meme content and frankly, Garfield is an overrated cartoon.
2.  <strong>Bearded Guy:</strong> 4/10. A random face isn't a server icon; it's lazy.
3.  <strong>Soccer Player:</strong> 6/10. Slightly better, at least it's a person doing something, but still generic.
4.  <strong>EK:</strong> 3/10. Uninspired design, colors are bland.
5.  <strong>Lamp:</strong> 4/10. Boring and too minimalistic
6.  <strong>Dante:</strong> 8/10. This is a cool icon and I like it.
7.  <strong>Estonia ball:</strong> 7/10. This looks creative.
8.  <strong>Tv bars:</strong> 5/10. Is this a server for TV bars
9.  <strong>Half-Life:</strong> 8/10. It is the coolest icon on this list.
10. <strong>Folder:</strong> 2/10. Looks like it was randomly selected
11. <strong>CameraMan:</strong> 6/10. The man in the white suit looks fancy
12. <strong>baldman:</strong> 4/10. He looks like he enjoys his life
13. <strong>psychedelic man:</strong> 7/10. It is the most creative and coolest icon here.
14. <strong>Gaming Zone:</strong> 5/10. What is gaming zone
15. <strong>Hecu:</strong> 8/10. This one is nice as well.
16. <strong>Head with no brain:</strong> 3/10. what is this supposed to mean
17. <strong>AVM.B:</strong> 4/10. The name is too generic</div>
