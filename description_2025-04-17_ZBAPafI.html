  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-i0G-VgPfOuS0.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect Strawberry Meeth's Cousin, shall we?

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Strawberry Meeth's Cousin is a contestant in this object show. Not much else is provided, which already puts him at a disadvantage. He's riding on the coattails of his cousin, Strawberry Meeth, which is pathetic. 

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

He's literally a strawberry with cat ears. An absolute abomination, this is the worst design in the show, the guy should have just used a regular strawberry instead of this creature. The colors clash, it looks like he was assembled in a rush, and his presence is frankly offensive to both strawberries and cats.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Nonexistent. He's completely void of any discernible characteristics, which is infuriating. This character is useless, he has no personality, and his creators were smoking something when they came up with this abomination.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

Given that he's a strawberry with cat ears, his abilities probably extend to "being a berry" and "occasionally meowing." Pathetic. He's a useless addition to the show and brings nothing to the table.

<strong>Final Rating:</strong>

0/10. Strawberry Meeth's Cousin is the absolute worst character on this show. His appearance is an offense, his personality is nonexistent, and his abilities are underwhelming. I hope he gets eliminated first, and I'll personally celebrate the end of his sorry existence.</div>
