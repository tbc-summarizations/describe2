  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest assessment you asked for:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Marc-Andre Ter Stegen:</strong> 8.5 - A top-tier keeper, but can have lapses in concentration.

•   <strong>Joshua Kimmich:</strong> 7.5 - Overrated. Good technically, but lacks pace and can be exposed defensively.

•   <strong>Jonathan Tah:</strong> 6 - A physical presence, but prone to errors and clumsy in possession. Not a top defender.

•   <strong>Nico Elvedi:</strong> 5 - Solid enough, but not a standout. Unlikely to be a game-changer.

•   <strong>David Raum:</strong> 5 - Okay.

•   <strong>Dominik Szoboszlai:</strong> 7.5 - Talented and creative, but inconsistent. Needs to be more decisive.

•   <strong>Leon Goretzka:</strong> 6.5 - A decent all-rounder, but lacks a defining quality. Can be hot and cold.

•   <strong>Granit Xhaka:</strong> 7 - Improved in recent years, but still prone to rash decisions and disciplinary issues.

•   <strong>Leroy Sane:</strong> 6 - Inconsistent and frustrating. Has flashes of brilliance, but lacks the drive and consistency to be truly great.

•   <strong>Niclas Fullkrug:</strong> 6.5 - A decent target man, but not a clinical finisher.

•   <strong>Breel Embolo:</strong> 7 - A powerful and athletic forward, but lacks the finesse and composure to be a top striker.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5.5/10</strong> - This is a collection of decent players who lack the cohesion, tactical identity, and killer instinct to be a truly great team. They have some individual quality, but there are too many weaknesses defensively, and the attack lacks the cutting edge to consistently win games. This squad is more likely to be frustratingly inconsistent than a genuine contender.</div>
