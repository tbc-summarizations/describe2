  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of the Astana 2015-16 Champions League squad, player by player, followed by the overall squad rating:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Branimir Stoilov 🇧🇬:</strong> 6/10. A competent manager who got the best out of a limited squad. His tactics were solid, but lacked the innovation to really trouble top European teams.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Nenad Erić 🇰🇿:</strong> 7/10. A decent shot-stopper with experience, but prone to errors under pressure.
•   <strong>Mikhail Golubnichi 🇰🇿:</strong> 2/10. Backup at best, unlikely to make a significant contribution.
•   <strong>Vladimir Loginovsky 🇰🇿:</strong> 2/10. Same as Golubnichi, a roster filler.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Eldos Akhmetov 🇰🇿:</strong> 3/10. Lacking the quality for Champions League level.
•   <strong>Marin Aničić 🇧🇦:</strong> 6/10. A reasonably solid defender, but not particularly mobile or gifted technically.
•   <strong>Abzal Beisebekov 🇰🇿:</strong> 5/10. Industrious but limited in ability.
•   <strong>Branko Ilić 🇸🇮:</strong> 6/10. Experienced, but past his prime and lacking pace.
•   <strong>Birzhan Kulbekov 🇰🇿:</strong> 2/10. Not Champions League material.
•   <strong>Igor Pikalkin 🇰🇿:</strong> 2/10. Unlikely to make an impact at this level.
•   <strong>Yevgeny Postnikov 🇰🇿:</strong> 5/10. A serviceable defender, but nothing special.
•   <strong>Dmitry Shomko 🇰🇿:</strong> 6/10. A decent left-back with some attacking potential.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Denys Dedechko 🇺🇦:</strong> 5/10. A functional midfielder, but lacking in creativity.
•   <strong>Foxi Kéthévoama 🇨🇫:</strong> 6/10. A hard-working player with occasional moments of flair.
•   <strong>Rinat Khairullin 🇰🇿:</strong> 3/10. Not good enough for this level.
•   <strong>Nemanja Maksimović 🇷🇸:</strong> 7/10. One of the better players in the squad, a solid defensive midfielder with good potential.
•   <strong>Serikzhan Muzhikov 🇰🇿:</strong> 5/10. Decent but unremarkable.
•   <strong>Roger Cañas 🇨🇴:</strong> 6/10. A tough-tackling midfielder, but lacking in finesse.
•   <strong>Georgiy Zhukov 🇰🇿:</strong> 4/10. Not ready for the Champions League.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Bauyrzhan Dzholchiyev 🇰🇿:</strong> 3/10. Doesn't offer much at this level.
•   <strong>Junior Kabananga 🇨🇩:</strong> 6/10. Quick and powerful, but lacks composure in front of goal.
•   <strong>Zhakyp Kozhamberdy 🇰🇿:</strong> 2/10. Won't make a difference.
•   <strong>Tanat Nuserbaev 🇰🇿:</strong> 4/10. Limited goal-scoring ability.
•   <strong>Aleksey Shchetkin 🇰🇿:</strong> 4/10. Not prolific enough.
•   <strong>Patrick Twumasi 🇬🇭:</strong> 7/10. The most dangerous attacker in the squad, with pace and skill.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong> 4/10

This Astana squad was severely lacking in quality, especially compared to other teams in the Champions League. They were heavily reliant on a few key players and lacked the depth and talent to compete consistently at the highest level. Their success was more a testament to their organization and work ethic than individual brilliance.</div>
