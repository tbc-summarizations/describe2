  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because here's how these Round 7 matches are REALLY going to go down. No holding back, no sugarcoating.

â€¢   <strong>Slovenia ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡® vs. Iceland ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸:</strong> Slovenia wins in a gritty, underwhelming affair. Iceland's defense is scrappy, but their attack is toothless. Scoreline: Slovenia 2 - 1 Iceland. Expect lots of fouls and frustrated Icelandic fans.

â€¢   <strong>Croatia ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡· vs. Austria ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹:</strong> Croatia's experience will see them through but they will be exposed by an aging team. Austria's pressing is relentless, but Croatia will barely survive. Scoreline: Croatia 3 - 2 Austria. Buckle up as fans will be at each other's throats over bad calls.

â€¢   <strong>Finland ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® vs. Denmark ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°:</strong> Denmark absolutely trounces Finland. The Finns are simply outclassed in every area. Scoreline: Finland 0 - 4 Denmark. It's gonna be a painful day for Finnish football fans.

â€¢   <strong>Czech Republic ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ vs. Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª:</strong> Germany will be ruthless and take advantage of Czech Republic's mistakes. The Germans are efficient and clinical, and the Czechs will wilt under the pressure. Scoreline: Czech Republic 1 - 3 Germany.

â€¢   <strong>Spain ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ vs. Sweden ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª:</strong> Spain will dominate possession, as usual, but Sweden's counterattacks will keep them in the game. Spain eventually breaks through, but it's a frustrating watch for anyone not invested in Spanish football. Scoreline: Spain 2 - 1 Sweden. Zzzzz.

â€¢   <strong>Romania ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ vs. North Macedonia ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡°:</strong> A hard-fought victory for the Romanians. Both sides are evenly matched in terms of quality, but Romania's home advantage proves decisive. Scoreline: Romania 2 - 1 North Macedonia. Expect plenty of cards and heated moments.</div>
