  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of the Euro 2024 group stage matches involving Poland, Netherlands, Austria, and France:

<strong>Poland:</strong> They're cannon fodder in this group. Lewandowski can't carry them alone anymore. Expect them to struggle to score and get consistently outplayed. Their defense is shaky, and their midfield lacks creativity. 

<strong>Netherlands:</strong> They'll be a tough, organized team but lack that true spark. They'll win games they should win, probably losing to France. They'll make it out of the group stage.

<strong>Austria:</strong> A decent team with some fight in them. They'll scrap for points, but they won't be able to contend with the bigger teams. Expect them to finish third in the group.

<strong>France:</strong> They're the favorites and they'll play like it. Expect clinical finishing, and tactical dominance. They should breeze through the group stage. They'll probably not drop a single point.</div>
