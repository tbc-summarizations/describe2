<strong>Paris Saint-Germain Squad Rating: 7/10</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Donnarumma (6/10) - Overrated. Prone to blunders, hasn't lived up to the hype.
•   <strong>Defenders:</strong> Mendes (7/10) - Solid going forward, defensively suspect. Pacho (6/10) - A decent signing, but nothing special. Marquinhos (7/10) - Past his prime, leadership is questionable. Hakimi (8/10) - World-class going forward, occasionally forgets he's a defender.
•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong> Ruiz (6/10) - Inconsistent, flashes of brilliance overshadowed by mediocrity. Vitinha (7/10) - Decent workrate, lacks creativity. Neves (8/10) - Promising talent, but unproven at this level.
•   <strong>Attackers:</strong> Kvaratskhelia (9/10) - PSG's only proper world class player other than Hakimi. Dembele (7/10) - All pace and no brain, end product is appalling. Doue (7/10) - Young and raw, potential is there but needs refining.

<strong>PSG Team Rating: 7/10</strong>

A collection of individuals, not a team. Too reliant on individual brilliance. Luis Enrique's tactics are hit-or-miss, often leading to tactical disarray.

<strong>Inter Milan Squad Rating: 8/10</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Sommer (7/10) - A reliable veteran, but limited.
•   <strong>Defenders:</strong> Bastoni (8/10) - Solid defender, excellent in possession. Acerbi (7/10) - Experienced, but slow. Pavard (8/10) - Versatile, dependable, a good signing.
•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong> Dimarco (7/10) - Consistent, but lacks the X-factor. Mkhitaryan (7/10) - Experienced, but legs are going. Calhanoglu (8/10) - Dictates the tempo, excellent passer. Barella (9/10) - Energy, passion, and quality. Dumfries (7/10) - Good physically, but limited technically.
•   <strong>Attackers:</strong> Martinez (9/10) - Clinical finisher, leader of the line. Thuram (8/10) - Pace, power, and a decent goal threat.

<strong>Inter Milan Team Rating: 8/10</strong>

A well-drilled, tactically astute team. Inzaghi has built a cohesive unit. They lack the individual brilliance of PSG, but make up for it with teamwork and tactical discipline.

<strong>2024/25 Champions League Final Prediction: Paris Saint-Germain vs. Inter Milan</strong>

<strong>Result:</strong> Inter Milan 3 - 1 Paris Saint-Germain

<strong>Analysis:</strong>

PSG will start strong, dominating possession and creating chances. However, their defensive frailties will be exposed by Inter's clinical counter-attacks. Martinez and Thuram will run riot, and the midfield battle will be won by Inter's superior tactical organization.

PSG's Kvaratskhelia will score a stunning goal to level the scores, giving PSG hope. However, Inter's experience and tactical nous will see them through.

<strong>Key Moments:</strong>

•   <strong>20th Minute:</strong> Lautaro Martinez goal after a defensive error.
•   <strong>55th Minute:</strong> Kvaratskhelia equalizes with a screamer from outside the box.
•   <strong>70th Minute:</strong> Marcus Thuram scores after a well-worked counter-attack.
•   <strong>90+2 Minute:</strong> Nicolo Barella scores a screamer after a failed PSG set-piece to seal the victory.

<strong>Why Inter Will Win:</strong>

•   <strong>Tactical Superiority:</strong> Inzaghi will outmaneuver Enrique.
•   <strong>Defensive Solidity:</strong> Inter's defense is far more organized.
•   <strong>Clinical Finishing:</strong> Martinez and Thuram are more ruthless than PSG's attackers.
•   <strong>Midfield Control:</strong> Inter's midfield will dominate the midfield battle.

<strong>Brutal Truth:</strong>

PSG is a house of cards, ready to crumble under pressure. Inter Milan will expose their flaws and claim a well-deserved Champions League title. The Parisians' dream of European glory will turn into another year of bitter disappointment.</div>
