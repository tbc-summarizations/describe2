  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest rating of that starting XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Thibaut Courtois (Belgium): 9/10 - World-class keeper, consistently performs at the highest level.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>
•   Zeno Debast (Belgium): 5/10 - Shows promise, but still raw and prone to errors.
•   Timothy Castagne (Belgium): 7/10 - Solid, dependable, but not a game-changer.
•   Wout Faes (Belgium): 6/10 - Can be a bit reckless, needs more consistency.
•   Norbert Gyomber (Slovakia): 5/10 - A decent player, but nothing special for a top team.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   Hans Vanaken (Belgium): 6/10 - Good technical ability, but lacks the pace and dynamism for top-tier football.
•   Kevin De Bruyne (Belgium): 10/10 - One of the best midfielders in the world, can unlock any defense.
•   Ondrej Duda (Slovakia): 5/10 - Average player, lacks the quality to make a significant impact.
•   Stanislav Lobotka (Slovakia): 6/10 - A decent ball-winning midfielder, but limited in other areas.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>
•   Romelu Lukaku (Belgium): 7/10 - A powerful striker, but inconsistent and can disappear in big games.
•   Michy Batshuayi (Belgium): 6/10 - A decent finisher, but not a consistent starter for a top team.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

Overall: 6.5/10

<strong>Analysis:</strong>

The team is heavily reliant on the brilliance of Kevin De Bruyne and the goalkeeping of Courtois. The defense has some weak links, and the midfield lacks the necessary balance and quality to compete at the highest level. Lukaku can be a threat, but Batshuayi isn't consistent enough to be relied upon as a main striker. The team looks really unbalanced. Overall, this team would struggle against top opposition due to its defensive vulnerabilities and lack of consistent firepower.</div>
