  <h1>Description for 20250322_214019.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">This screenshot from Family Guy is absolutely appalling. The fact that they would even depict a character in KKK garb is disgusting and inexcusable. It's not funny, it's not clever, and it's deeply offensive. The comment below it is right â€“ this is a step too far, even for a show known for pushing boundaries. Peter's hateful behavior in this episode is not amusing, and the writers should be ashamed for perpetuating such harmful imagery. They should've never aired this garbage.</div>
