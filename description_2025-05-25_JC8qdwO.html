  <h1>Description for 800px-AFC_Bournemouth_28201329.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest, no-holds-barred assessment of Bournemouth's squad:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Andoni Iraola (🇪🇸):</strong> He had a decent season this year with them and I rate it higher than most people do. 6.5/10.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Kepa Arrizabalaga (🇪🇸):</strong> He is not good by any means and I think a lot of fans only rate him highly because he is Spanish. 4/10
•   <strong>Will Dennis (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> No idea who this guy is. No opinion, but probably mediocre at best. 2/10

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Adam Smith (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Veteran presence, but clearly declining. Championship level at best now. 3/10
•   <strong>James Hill (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Decent potential, but hasn't shown enough to be a consistent starter in the Premier League. 4/10
•   <strong>Julian Araujo (🇲🇽):</strong> Highly overrated because he's Mexican. Solid defensively, but offers nothing going forward. 3/10
•   <strong>Marcos Senesi (🇦🇷):</strong> Can be a liability with poor decision-making. Another overrated player. 4/10
•   <strong>Illia Zabarnyi (🇺🇦):</strong> Possibly the best defender in the squad right now. Has some potential. 6/10
•   <strong>Matai Akinmboni (🇺🇸):</strong> Unknown, so I cannot rate him.
•   <strong>Dean Huijsen (🇪🇸):</strong> Young, inexperienced, but shows some promise. 5/10
•   <strong>Milos Kerkez (🇭🇺):</strong> Aggressive, reckless. Can be a handful, but also prone to mistakes. 5/10
•   <strong>Julio Soler (🇦🇷):</strong> Another no-name. Doubt he'll make any impact. 2/10
•   <strong>Zain Silcott-Duberry (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Yet another irrelevant player. 1/10

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Ryan Christie (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿):</strong> Workhorse, but lacks the quality to be a game-changer. 5/10
•   <strong>Lewis Cook (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Decent player. 6/10
•   <strong>Tyler Adams (🇺🇸):</strong> Overhyped because he is American. Mid. 4/10
•   <strong>Alex Scott (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Promising young talent. 6/10
•   <strong>Ben Winterburn (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Irrelevant. 1/10
•   <strong>Justin Kluivert (🇳🇱):</strong> Can be good some days. Very inconsistent. 5/10

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>David Brooks (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿):</strong> Talented, but injury-prone. 5/10
•   <strong>Marcus Tavernier (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Decent creative player. Can score good goals. 7/10
•   <strong>Luis Sinisterra (🇨🇴):</strong> Another decent player. 6/10
•   <strong>Antoine Semenyo (🇬🇭):</strong> Pace merchant. Raw, inconsistent. 4/10
•   <strong>Dango Ouattara (🇧🇫):</strong> Fast, but often clueless in the final third. 3/10
•   <strong>Michael DaCosta (🇪🇸):</strong> Who? 1/10
•   <strong>Remy Rees-Dottin (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿):</strong> Stop it with the nobody players. 1/10
•   <strong>Enes Ünal (🇹🇷):</strong> Okay player. 6/10
•   <strong>Evanilson (🇧🇷):</strong> Decent player. 6/10
•   <strong>Daniel Jebbison (🇨🇦):</strong> Inexperienced and overrated because he's Canadian. 2/10

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

<strong>4.5/10</strong> - Honestly, a very mediocre squad. Relies too heavily on a few players and lacks depth in crucial positions. I don't believe this is a top half team. I'm expecting Bournemouth to struggle massively this season.</div>
