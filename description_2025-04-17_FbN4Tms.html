  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my take on Atletico Madrid, from the object show:

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Atletico Madrid, referred to as ATM by the show's host, is a contestant of the second season of the object show. ATM is a shield with the logo of the real life football team with the same name. Despite not having much screen time yet, they seem like a contender due to a alliance with a certain competitor that is very strong.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Atletico Madrid's design mirrors the logo of the real-life football club: a shield bearing a tree and a bear, along with red and white stripes and stars. The showâ€™s version of the logo has a visible outline, and, like most of the other characters, it includes visible limbs. ATM is also seen with a smile.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

In his brief appearance, ATM comes across as overly happy and optimistic, especially concerning the prospect of having Violator and Rasmus as teammates. 

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

We do not have enough information on what capabilities ATM has, but so far it is yet to show them.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Honestly, Atletico Madrid is a character that might be a bit annoying if the show focused solely on his joyfulness for the nature as well as for football. 4/10 stars.</div>
