  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's how I see those semi-finals going down, no holds barred:

<strong>Belgium vs. Portugal:</strong> 

Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª <strong>3 - 1</strong> Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

â€¢   <strong>Belgium's Ruthless Efficiency:</strong> Belgium's got a killer instinct right now, a generation hitting its peak. They're going to smother Portugal's creativity. Kevin De Bruyne is going to be the conductor of a brutal symphony of attacking football. Expect him to carve open Portugal's midfield with pinpoint passes.
â€¢   <strong>Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo's struggles:</strong> Ronaldo's getting older, plain and simple. He'll still get his goal, a moment of brilliance. But Belgium's defense is too organized, too disciplined to let him dictate the game. He'll be visibly frustrated.
â€¢   <strong>Lukaku's Domination:</strong> Romelu Lukaku will bully Portugal's defenders, they'll get an early goal. This'll force Portugal out of their game plan, exposing them to Belgium's counter-attacks.
â€¢   <strong>The Midfield Battle:</strong> Portugal's midfield lacks the raw power to compete with Belgium's. They will get overrun.

<strong>Netherlands vs. Spain:</strong> 

Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± <strong>1 - 2</strong> Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

â€¢   <strong>Spain's Possession Masterclass:</strong> Spain's not the tiki-taka team of old, but they still know how to control the ball. They'll suffocate the Netherlands' attacking chances by keeping possession.
â€¢   <strong>The Netherlands' reliance on counter-attacks:</strong> The Dutch will be dangerous on the counter, but Spain's defenders are too experienced to get caught out repeatedly.
â€¢   <strong>Spain's Midfield Control:</strong> Spain's midfield, spearheaded by Pedri and Gavi, will be too creative and relentless for the Netherlands' midfield to handle. They'll dictate the tempo and find the killer passes.
â€¢   <strong>Wastefulness in the Attack:</strong> Both teams might struggle with converting chances. But Spain will have the edge due to their ability to create more opportunities.
â€¢   <strong>Late Drama:</strong> This'll be a tight, tactical affair, decided by a late goal. Spain's superior depth off the bench will give them the edge.

There you have it. Not pretty, but brutally honest. If you want a softer version, ask someone else, because I'm not backing down from this prediction.</div>
