  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this squad with the brutal honesty you asked for:

<strong>Individual Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Bart Verbruggen:</strong> 6.5 - Promising talent, but lacks consistent top-level experience. A bit of a gamble in goal.
•   <strong>Jan Bednarek:</strong> 5 - Prone to errors and lacks pace. A weak link defensively.
•   <strong>Stefan De Vrij:</strong> 6.5 - Past his prime, lacks the agility for modern football. Can be solid positionally but struggles against quick attackers.
•   <strong>Virgil Van Dijk:</strong> 7.5 - Still a commanding presence, but his pace has noticeably declined. Relies heavily on his positioning and experience now.
•   <strong>Jere Uronen:</strong> 5.5 - Solid but unspectacular. Offers little going forward and can be exposed defensively.
•   <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum:</strong> 6 - A shadow of his former self. Lacks the dynamism and energy he once possessed. Offers little creativity in midfield.
•   <strong>Frenkie De Jong:</strong> 8 - The best player in this lineup. Excellent on the ball, dictating play, and breaking lines.
•   <strong>Xavi Simons:</strong> 7 - Talented and skillful, but inconsistent. Needs to add more end product to his game to be a truly top player.
•   <strong>Piotr Zielinski:</strong> 7 - A decent player, good vision and link-up play.
•   <strong>Cody Gakpo:</strong> 7 - Decent pace.
•   <strong>Memphis Depay:</strong> 6.5 - Inconsistent and frustrating. Can produce moments of brilliance but often disappears in big games.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

Overall, this team gets a <strong>5.5/10</strong>. It's a collection of players with a few bright spots (De Jong), but the overall quality and balance are lacking. The defense is slow and error-prone, the midfield lacks dynamism, and the attack is too reliant on individual brilliance. I wouldn't expect this team to go far in any major competition. They lack the cohesiveness and quality to compete with the top sides.</div>
