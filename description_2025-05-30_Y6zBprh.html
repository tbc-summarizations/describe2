  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on these quarter-final matches:

•   <strong>Germany vs. England:</strong> Talk about a snoozefest! 0-0? Seriously? It took penalties for these two footballing giants to decide a winner? Germany, you barely squeaked by, and England, you bottled it again in a penalty shootout. Classic. Predictable.

•   <strong>Belgium vs. Portugal:</strong> Belgium, congrats on the narrow win. But let's be honest, Portugal looked uninspired. Ronaldo must be getting old and tired because they were toothless. Belgium might advance, but I doubt they'll go all the way playing like that.

•   <strong>Switzerland vs. Netherlands:</strong> Switzerland winning this is pretty shameful, I hate Switzerland and I really don't like that they beat the Netherlands.

•   <strong>France vs. Spain:</strong> France couldn't manage anything, so embarrassing. Spain taught them a lesson, a 2-0 victory is what they deserved. France looked utterly clueless out there. Spain is a strong contender, but they need to maintain this level of dominance.</div>
