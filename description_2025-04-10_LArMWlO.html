  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this video is about to get cooked even more than it already is.

<strong>General Impressions:</strong>

•   First off, whoever made this should probably stick to stick figures because these character designs look like they were ripped straight out of a kindergarten sketchbook. The "art" is so offensively bad, it's almost impressive.
•   The animation is janky as all hell. It's like watching a slideshow with occasional seizures thrown in for good measure.
•   The audio is a cacophony of bad voice acting and even worse editing.

<strong>Specific Roasts:</strong>

•   <strong>The intro triangle:</strong> "Hello everybody..." Wow, real original. Starting with a generic greeting and then talking about 6th object show you idiot? At least the intro triangle is self aware about how little he can act.

•   <strong>Angry cheese/ sponge</strong>: That cheese chunk that is calling triangle stupid. Is not very smart either because he also doesn't know if it's the fifth or sixth object show, how did that fool not die already?

•   <strong>Pluto:</strong> A sphere as "I'm Pluto". Great joke about forgetting the planetary status!
•   <strong>The triangle getting a makeover, but still looking like a mess:</strong> Oh my god, you changed color! We truly have a master artist among us. That transformation was so dramatic, it almost made me care.
•   <strong>Cool ball:</strong> "I am the cooler than the other guys..." If you say that, that's immediately a lie, and I'm not talking in the cartoon but in real life too.
•   <strong>The Roblox-esque book/bottle thing:</strong> Ah, yes, a walking advertisement for Roblox. The only good thing I can say is, at least the color scheme vaguely matches.
•   <strong>Plane that did 9/11</strong>: Dude really doesn't have any shame. Also the voice was horrible, and he isn't funny.
•   <strong>The stickman that is NOT FNF guy:</strong> Oh please dude. You are literally stick figure art. And you are from Friday night funkin. This has nothing to do with not being a clown. You probably had a cringe voice.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan ball.</strong> "The greatest country in the world" shut the hell up.
•   <strong>The emoji that can be anything</strong> Oh, an emoji. How... original? You can "be anything," huh? Well, try being funny for once.
•   <strong>The cat.</strong> Yeah just a cat. What a waste.
•   <strong>The snob."</strong> "I get all the bitches!". What? Also, shut your mouth if you get out next.

<strong>ROAST THE CHALLENGE!!!! (Kill yourself and if you do win the second time)</strong>
Oh and the challenge is very weird, just kill yourself? What was bro thinking, just let them all die right away idiot.

<strong>Challenge 2</strong>

The second challenge is for teams to not get stealed by Romania. Whaaaaaat??? This is even more strange. Also it looks like Romania is the main character.


<strong>Other thoughts on the video.</strong>

•   The part where was said it is a birthday special: Great! Then why are the other contestants forced to participate in this cringe-fest?
•   That "ha ha, team is getting mad because they lose" that guy is stupid and is not doing anything so, if his team loses, then it is his fault and he is going to get elininated. And then "We should accept for that because it is result of war", so cringe ngl.

<strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> This video is not only uninspired; it's also poorly executed, incredibly tone-deaf, and a complete waste of time. The person who made it should probably consider a different hobby, like collecting dust or something.

There, I did as you asked. Anything else you want me to tear apart?</div>
