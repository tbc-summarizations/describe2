  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cut through the pleasantries and get to the cold, hard truth about these Euro 2024 group stage matches.

<strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮</strong>

Let's be real, Slovenia is the underdog in this group, plain and simple. They'll fight hard, but they lack the overall quality to consistently compete with the big boys. Expect them to scrap for draws, but ultimately fall short against the likes of England and Denmark. They might snatch a win against Serbia if they get lucky and Serbia implodes, but that's a big "if."

<strong>Denmark 🇩🇰</strong>

Denmark is a solid, well-organized team, but they're not exactly world-beaters. They'll probably secure a comfortable win against Slovenia. I expect them to take second place in the group, I feel they lack the firepower to challenge England for the top spot, and their midfield might be a little too predictable. Expect a pragmatic, but ultimately underwhelming, performance.

<strong>Serbia 🇷🇸</strong>

Serbia is always a team that promises so much and delivers so little. They've got talented individuals, but their team cohesion is always questionable. They'll likely frustrate their fans with inconsistent performances, losing points against Slovenia and Denmark. Expect plenty of drama and disappointment as they underachieve once again.

<strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿</strong>

England is the clear favorite to top the group. They have the quality and depth to dominate these games. They'll coast through the group stage with minimal effort, securing comfortable wins against Slovenia, Denmark, and Serbia. Expect them to win against Slovenia with 3 goals at least. Their real test will come in the knockout stages, but they should breeze through the group stage.

In short, England will likely win, Denmark is likely to come second. Slovenia and Serbia are likely to have a 50-50 battle to avoid last place and a humiliating exit.</div>
