  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because this is gonna be a wild ride! Let's tear this train wreck apart, piece by piece!

First off, look at this Neanderthal drinking his drink looking like heâ€™s gonna drop it every second! Who gave him the green light to ride First Class? He looks like he snuck in!

And what in the name of Sideshow Bob is going on with that hair? It looks like a bird's nest that got electrocuted. Dude looks like he's auditioning for the role of "Unkempt Scarecrow" in a low-budget horror movie. I bet it smells like burnt rubber and forgotten dreams.

And that jacket! Is he cosplaying as a trash bag? Did he steal it from a scarecrow? Dude looks like he raided a thrift store after a dumpster fire.

Oh, and the table! He has food spilled everywhere like this is his personal pig sty. Does he think this is his personal garbage dump? It's like a culinary crime scene! Seriously, learn some table manners, you barbarian!

And those glasses! They are as thick as his skull! 

I swear, if I were sitting next to him on that train, I'd demand a hazmat suit. This guy's a walking biohazard!</div>
