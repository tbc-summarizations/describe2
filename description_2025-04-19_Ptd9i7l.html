  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-Ono-KN6E1MbU.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my ranking of those characters from worst to best, based on sheer entertainment value and how they've been used in the video:

<strong>Absolute Bottom Tier</strong>

1.  <strong>Face [F]:</strong> A literal smiley face? Come on. It's the most boring, uninspired character of all. They add nothing.
2.  <strong>Aldi [B]:</strong> A logo from a German supermarket chain. I feel like the creator just ran out of ideas and threw this in.
3.  <strong>George W. Bush:</strong> Not really a character, but I don't like him very much.
4.  <strong>Plunger [K]:</strong> A literal toilet plunger. This is just lazy.
5.  <strong>Coconut Elephant [C]:</strong> Cutting a coconut shape out of an elephant's side is weird and has no humor.

<strong>Low Tier</strong>

6.  <strong>AK-47 [A]:</strong> Hates everyone.
7.  <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin [L]:</strong> It's just a strawberry with a USB drive. What's even supposed to be interesting about it?
8.  <strong>Minecraft Cow [D]:</strong> Pretty generic. I can't be bothered to care about this one.

<strong>Mid Tier</strong>

9.  <strong>This Fucking Cat [G]:</strong> A cat. Okay, a cat is fine.
10. <strong>Gato De Naranjas [H]:</strong> The "Cat of Oranges" has a better, more striking image than the other cat, and at least there's some novelty to it.

<strong>High Tier</strong>

11. <strong>Al Gore:</strong> I guess he's the main dude.
12. <strong>The Black Khan of Mongolia:</strong> Funny faces
13. <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed [USSR SURVIVES]:</strong> I like his design and backstory.
14. <strong>Grappling Hook [I]:</strong> I found this character a little more inventive.

<strong>Top Tier</strong>

15. <strong>Kanye West [J]:</strong> His inclusion as a character that just ignores everything is actually pretty funny.
16. <strong>Evil Venus [E]:</strong> This is a more interesting and creative design.
17. <strong>Atomic Bomb [J]:</strong>
18. <strong>Cold Cow:</strong> I like his background.
19. <strong>Steak:</strong> Tries to be nice to everyone.
20. <strong>The Lion and The Small Dog When It Barks:</strong> I agree.
