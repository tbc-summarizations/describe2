  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest take on Matchday 5:

•   <strong>France 🇫🇷 1-1 Spain 🇪🇸:</strong> A snooze-fest between two overrated teams. France continues to underperform with their golden generation, while Spain is just a shadow of its former glory. A draw that helps neither regain their status as footballing giants.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 2-0 Netherlands 🇳🇱:</strong> England manages a rare convincing win, but let's be honest, it's against a Dutch side that's still rebuilding. Don't get ahead of yourselves, lads; tougher tests await and you'll choke like always.
•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 1-0 Portugal 🇵🇹:</strong> A narrow win for Belgium's aging squad against a Portugal side overly reliant on Ronaldo's fading brilliance. Both teams are living on borrowed time, clinging to past glories.
•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 1-2 Germany 🇩🇪:</strong> Italy, the reigning European champions, get outplayed by Germany who are just better. This match proves that Italy's Euro win was a fluke and Germany is still one of the best teams on Earth.
•   <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭 3-0 Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> A shocking result! Switzerland dismantled Croatia, proving they are not the same side they were 5 years ago. Maybe time to call it a day for the old guard?
•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 0-0 Austria 🇦🇹:</strong> A truly forgettable match. Neither team showed any ambition or creativity. A draw that satisfies no one and further proves that both teams are just making up numbers in the tournament.
•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 1-0 Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> A scrappy win for Turkey against a resilient Ukraine. Both teams are far from being contenders, but Turkey showed more fight and deserves the victory.
•   <strong>Sweden 🇸🇪 2-1 Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> Sweden edges out Wales in a hard-fought match. Wales' fairytale run is clearly over, and they lack the quality to compete with the best. Sweden, on the other hand, might surprise a few people with their grit and determination.</div>
