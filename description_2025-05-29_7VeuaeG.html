  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Feyenoord winning on penalties after a 2-2 draw? Let's be honest, Marseille choked. They had the slightly better stats, the man of the match, and still couldn't seal the deal. Typical French team performance if you ask me.

Feyenoord, on the other hand, might not have been the statistical dominators, but they had the guts to take it to penalties and the composure to win. That's all that matters. While their average player rating was embarrassing, that's why they are who they are (mediocre), they only won due to plot armor.

As for Gouiri being man of the match, who cares? He scored a goal, but his team still lost. A meaningless distinction for a loser.

In the end, Feyenoord celebrated while the French team flew home in shame. That's all that will be written in the history books.</div>
