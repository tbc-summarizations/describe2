  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this 2006 Italy squad with brutal honesty:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Coach Marcello Lippi:</strong> 9/10 - Tactically astute, managed egos well, and got the best out of a talented squad. The man was a master of creating a winning mentality, although some might argue he benefited from a bit of luck along the way.

•   <strong>Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon:</strong> 10/10 - Peak Buffon. Immovable, commanding, and a true world-class goalkeeper at the absolute top of his game. A rock at the back.

•   <strong>Goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi:</strong> 6/10 - A solid backup, but nothing spectacular. Reliable if needed, but not a game-changer.

•   <strong>Goalkeeper Marco Amelia:</strong> 4/10 - More of a squad filler. Doubtful he'd have made much difference if he played.

•   <strong>Defender Cristian Zaccardo:</strong> 5/10 - Decent, but largely unremarkable. Did his job without standing out, for better or worse.

•   <strong>Defender Fabio Grosso:</strong> 8/10 - Scored crucial goals and was surprisingly effective going forward. Overrated because of the goals he scored.

•   <strong>Defender Fabio Cannavaro:</strong> 10/10 - World-class. Led the defense with authority, won the Ballon d'Or, and was simply immense.

•   <strong>Defender Andrea Barzagli:</strong> 6/10 - Solid, dependable, but not a star at this point in his career.

•   <strong>Defender Alessandro Nesta:</strong> 8/10 - Classy and elegant defender. Unfortunately, his injury hampered his impact on the tournament.

•   <strong>Defender Gianluca Zambrotta:</strong> 8/10 - Versatile and energetic. A reliable presence on either flank.

•   <strong>Defender Massimo Oddo:</strong> 5/10 - Another squad player. Not terrible, but nothing special.

•   <strong>Defender Marco Materazzi:</strong> 7/10 - Controversial, but effective. A tough, physical player who could also score important goals (and get sent off).

•   <strong>Midfielder Daniele De Rossi:</strong> 7/10 - Talented but prone to rash decisions. His red card was a low point, but he had his moments.

•   <strong>Midfielder Gennaro Gattuso:</strong> 9/10 - The heart and soul of the midfield. A relentless ball-winner and a true warrior.

•   <strong>Midfielder Mauro Camoranesi:</strong> 7/10 - A hard-working player with moments of quality. Provided energy and width.

•   <strong>Midfielder Simone Barone:</strong> 5/10 - Another functional player. Did his job without setting the world on fire.

•   <strong>Midfielder Simone Perrotta:</strong> 6/10 - A useful squad player who could fill in where needed.

•   <strong>Midfielder Andrea Pirlo:</strong> 9/10 - The architect of the team. His vision and passing were exceptional, and he dictated the tempo of the games.

•   <strong>Forward Alessandro Del Piero:</strong> 7/10 - A legend, but past his prime. Still capable of moments of brilliance, though.

•   <strong>Forward Luca Toni:</strong> 7/10 - Scored some important goals, but could also be frustratingly inconsistent.

•   <strong>Forward Francesco Totti:</strong> 7/10 - Not at his absolute best due to injury, but still a creative force and a valuable asset.

•   <strong>Forward Alberto Gilardino:</strong> 5/10 - Disappointing. Didn't make much of an impact when given the chance.

•   <strong>Forward Vincenzo Iaquinta:</strong> 6/10 - Scored a goal but was largely forgettable.

•   <strong>Forward Filippo Inzaghi:</strong> 7/10 - An opportunistic goalscorer. Came on and scored a crucial goal, proving his value.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

8/10 - A strong and well-balanced squad with a mix of experience and talent. They weren't always the most exciting team to watch, but they were incredibly difficult to beat. Deserved winners.</div>
