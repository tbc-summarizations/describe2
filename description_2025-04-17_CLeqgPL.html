  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's an essay about Stickman from the object show provided:

<strong>Stickman: A Brutal and Unflinching Analysis</strong>

Stickman is a contestant in the object show, seemingly a generic everyman character thrown into a bizarre competition. This essay will delve into Stickman's general information, appearance, personality, and abilities.

<strong>General Information:</strong> 
Stickman's origins are vague and, frankly, uninteresting. He's back on the show after being eliminated pretty early last time, which tells me that he wasn't even entertaining the first time round. He now expects us to believe he’s going to be good this time.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>
He's exactly what his name suggests: a stick figure. He has a featureless oval head, dotted eyes, a mouth, and stick arms and legs. His design is lazy and unimaginative. Stickman is, quite simply, an eyesore.

<strong>Personality:</strong>
Stickman seems to lack any defining characteristics, making him bland and forgettable. He mentions getting eliminated early last time, showing an undercurrent of insecurity and self-doubt. He does then say hopefully that this time he will get “some chances”, but who knows if that will actually happen.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>
Stickman possesses no apparent abilities. He’s a blank slate, a default avatar in a world of vibrant, often bizarre competitors. He’s just another thing.

<strong>Rating:</strong>
Stickman is an absolutely useless contestant. He's physically and personality-wise unremarkable, bringing nothing to the table. Frankly, I don’t care about his participation, and I’m just going to skip any parts he’s included in.</div>
