  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here is your essay:

Emoji

General Information:
Emoji is a character from the object show featured in the media. The name seems to indicate it is some form of emoji.
External Appearance:
Emoji is shaped like a standard round emoji and is coloured a yellow hue. He shows many different faces that are commonly found in normal emojis.
Personality:
Emoji seems to be quite arrogant, as he says he has the ability to be anything; his personality appears to be reliant on his abilities, which implies that he has no base personality.
Abilities:
Emoji states, during his introduction, that he can be anything. While we don't see the extent of this ability, we see him morph into a skull, so we are led to believe that he has shapeshifting abilities.
Rating:
Heâ€™s a worthless piece of trash with 0 redeeming qualities. He has no personality, nor any traits. He would be the first one I would eliminate if I was on this show. I would give him a 0/10, as he is too worthless to grade higher.</div>
