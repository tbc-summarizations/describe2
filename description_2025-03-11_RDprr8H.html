  <div class="discord-text">(Beat drops â€“ heavy 808s, distorted synth bass, and a frantic hi-hat pattern)

<strong>Verse 1:</strong>
Yo, lemme set the record straight, this ain't no game
It's a lyrical execution, spitting fire in your face
Rocket League Henry, stuntin' with that digital bling?
You just a pixelated clown, chasin' balls, doin' nothin'
While I'm out here makin' moves, breakin' chains, and climbin' high.
You're stuck in the stadium, watchin' dreams pass by.
Tryna flex on the virtual ground, like a digital don,
While the real world burns around you. You're oblivious, gone.

<strong>Verse 2:</strong>
Roblox Henry, you're blocky and basic, no finesse.
Wearin' that dumb shirt, I ain't impressed, it's a mess.
"I heart Kazakhstan?" That's the best you could do?
You're corny, predictable, nobody cares about you.
Stuck in a low-res world, built of pixels and lies,
While I'm buildin' empires, reachin' for infinite skies.
So step aside, blockhead, your time is overdue,
This is a lyrical onslaught, I'm coming straight through.

<strong>Verse 3:</strong>
BFDI Henry, a pillow with a face, what's the deal?
Tryna look tough with that hat, but you ain't got no appeal.
You're soft and squishy, a punching bag for the weak,
While I'm hard as granite, with the words that I speak.
Trapped in a cartoon world, where logic takes a dive,
I spit reality, son, and watch your dreams die.
So go back to your competition, your petty little war,
'Cause in the real world, buddy, you ain't worth fighting for.

<strong>Verse 4:</strong>
Mario 64 Henry, glitching and falling apart.
That turquoise skin is just a broken start.
You're clinging to the past, a relic in decay,
I'm the future, the now, the words that light the way.
Climbing fences in a broken game, ain't nothing but sad.
I will take you down, quick, no one needs to be mad.
Your legacy's fading, your code's all corrupt,
You're done, over, finished.

(Beat fades out with a final, distorted 808 thump)</div>
