  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I think each person would respond:

•   <strong>Adolf Hitler:</strong> "This is an insult! A direct attack on the purity of our ideals. The maker of this mockery shall be punished!"

•   <strong>Donald Trump:</strong> "FAKE NEWS! SAD! Everyone knows minions are losers! They're probably working with the Deep State. I'm still your favorite president!"

•   <strong>Bernie Sanders:</strong> "This perfectly illustrates the crass commercialism of modern society. We need to redistribute the memes of production! And those minions? They need universal healthcare!"

•   <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.:</strong> "I have a dream... that one day little yellow creatures will be judged not by their pigmentation, but by the content of their character. This is... disappointing."

•   <strong>Ice Spice:</strong> "Erm... is this like, a diss track? Nah, fr, who made this? They obviously don't appreciate my baddie vibes."

•   <strong>Kanye West:</strong> "This is genius. I mean, I could do better. But the duality... it's YEEZY-esque! And that other part is inspiring!"

•   <strong>Santa Claus:</strong> "Ho ho... hold on! This isn't very Christmassy. Everyone gets coal this year. And maybe some sensitivity training."

•   <strong>George Floyd:</strong> "This is just another example of how racism can manifest in subtle ways. I understand the pain of being targeted and marginalized, and I hope that whoever created this video can learn to be more respectful and empathetic."

•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong> "Siiiu! This is not the celebration I deserve. It is not even close to my greatness. Now where is my CR7 birthday cake?"

•   <strong>KSI:</strong> "Yo, that's kinda jokes! But the minion at the end needs to chill with the hard R, fam. Not cool, not cool at all. But overall, not bad."

•   <strong>Kim Kardashian:</strong> "Okay, I kinda vibe with the minions. But that language? Cancelled! And someone get those minions a SKIMS collection ASAP."</div>
