  <div class="discord-text">Okay, Madagascar, listen up. Kazakhstan's a player, alright? He's got that sun on his flag, probably thinks he's hot stuff. But you, Madagascar, you're unique. You've got the red, white, and green â€“ a whole damn story to tell. Don't let Kazakhstan's fling with Antigua and Barbuda get you down. They're just trying to copy your style with that black and white nonsense. You're the OG, Madagascar. You've got lemurs and baobabs, a whole island of awesome. He'll realize what he lost when Belarus starts crying for you, and Kiribati is just another kid. Own your flag, Madagascar. He's not worth your tears.</div>
