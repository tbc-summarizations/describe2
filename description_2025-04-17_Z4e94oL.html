  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get down to analyzing that waste of space, SMB1 Luigi.

<strong>General Information:</strong>

SMB1 Luigi is some sad sack from the Mario universe. No idea why they let this loser in the game. I suspect that someone felt sorry for him, otherwise there's no logical reason for him to even be there.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

He looks as you would expect. The old green, blocky form with pixels. He describes himself as being small because he didn't get a mushroom. Honestly, it's probably that his small size is more a reflection of his actual existence. Pathetic.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

He is described as feeling regret from joining the show, which is actually understandable.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

He apparently doesn't even have a Mushroom, he could probably be stomped by a toddler let alone have any decent abilities.

<strong>Overall Rating:</strong>

This is the worst contestant in object show history. SMB1 Luigi gets a 0/10. Pointless, spineless, and an utter disappointment.</div>
