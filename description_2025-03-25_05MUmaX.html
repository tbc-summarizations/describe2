  <div class="discord-text">Jesus: "Listen here, you mop-haired heathens! Your music is an abomination! A cacophony of noise that offends the ears of God himself! Go back to whatever flea-bitten corner of the empire you crawled out of!"

John Lennon: "Oh, shove it up your tunic, mate! Your sandals-and-beard look is so last century. And that holier-than-thou attitude? It's pure wanker!"

Paul McCartney: "Yeah, Jesus, your parables are about as exciting as watching paint dry. We're bringing joy to the masses, not boring them to death with your doom and gloom!"

George Harrison: "And what's with all the miracles, eh? Turning water into wine? That's just showing off, you brown skin devil. We're all about peace and love, not cheap parlor tricks!"

Ringo Starr: "Can't we all just get along? I mean, you're both kinda famous, right? Let's just jam or something!"

Jesus: "Silence, you simpleton! You're as dense as a stone tablet! I'm the Son of God, and you dare to speak to me with such insolence? You're nothing but a bunch of degenerate long hairs!"

John Lennon: "Degenerate? At least we're not hanging out with Judas! Now there's a sneaky little rat if I've ever seen one!"

<em>A brawl erupts, with Jesus throwing a punch at Lennon, who retaliates with a swift kick to the shin. McCartney tries to intervene, but gets his nose tweaked by one of Jesus' disciples. George Harrison starts chanting "Hare Krishna" to confuse everyone, while Ringo Starr hides behind a pillar, banging on his knees like a drum.</em></div>
