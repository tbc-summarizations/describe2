  <h1>Description for five_nights_at_peru.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OK here's the story of them talking to each other

<em><strong>

</strong>Alisher</em><em> (the guy in the profile picture): </em>adjusts sunglasses<em> "Oi, lads, another day, another dollar. Or should I say, another som?"

<strong>Rauan</strong> (guy on the left): "Alisher, you're always on about the money. What about the glory? The adventure? The... </em>shudders<em>... potential jumpscares?"

<strong>Bauyrzhan</strong> (guy in the middle): "Rauan's right, Alisher. But I'm with you on the jumpscares. I swear I almost lost my kazy the other night."

<strong>Temirlan</strong> (guy on the right): "Can we please talk about something other than greasy horse meat? I'm trying to appreciate the atmospheric lighting here." </em>gestures vaguely at the blurry image<em>

<strong>Alisher:</strong> "Atmospheric lighting? You mean the glow coming from that fish tank? Temirlan, you've been playing too much of this game."

<strong>Rauan:</strong> "Speaking of the game, what's our strategy for tonight? I'm thinking we stick together, like a herd of wild horses on the steppe."

<strong>Bauyrzhan:</strong> "I'm in. But someone needs to watch my back. I still think that creepy Alpaca animatronic is targeting me."

<strong>Temirlan:</strong> "I'll keep an eye out for rogue Alpaca. But honestly, I'm more worried about the price. $59 for this janky FNAF clone? Even with our Tenges weakening, that's daylight robbery!"

<strong>Alisher:</strong> "Tell me about it. I could buy a whole goat with that money! A goat! We could have beshbarmak for days."

<strong>Rauan:</strong> "Alright, alright, enough complaining. Let's focus. We're Kazakh warriors, fearless in the face of digital horror. Now, who's got the courage to check the security cameras?"

<strong>Bauyrzhan:</strong> "Not me. I'm on Alpaca watch."

<strong>Temirlan:</strong> "Fine, I'll do it. But if I see anything even remotely scary, I'm blaming Alisher for making us waste our money on this."

<strong>Alisher:</strong> "Hey, I didn't force you to play. Besides, I'm sure it'll be worth it. Think of the YouTube views! The fame! The potential sponsorship deals with, uh... fermented mare's milk companies?"

<strong>Rauan:</strong> "Let's just play the game, Alisher. Please."

</em>They all sigh, bracing themselves for another night of terror at Five Nights at Peru.*</div>
