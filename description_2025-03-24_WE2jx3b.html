  <div class="discord-text">Safe fam, let's get straight to it innit. On my life, this TikTok bruv is looking a bit tapped. I can't lie, the hair is dry and the wall behind him ain't the coldest, styll. But you know what, big man ting, he's got the energy, man's got a massive smile. He's waving and everything, say no more G.

The tune, though? It's got a mad energy, I'll be so real. But it's giving a weird vibe when you see this bruv dancing. It's like, man's happy, but the tune is a cold ting. Mums life, I'm on the fence with this, fam. Maybe it's a joke, maybe it's deep. Calm, it's all gravy, safe still.</div>
