  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest roast of the UCL knockout phase play-off results you asked for, no holds barred:

•   <strong>Brest:</strong> 0-10? Were they even trying? They got absolutely demolished by PSG. Someone should check if they're still breathing after that massacre.
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> Okay, they won, but crushing a team like Brest doesn't prove anything. They probably still won't make it past the quarters, choking as usual.
•   <strong>Club Brugge:</strong> Somehow managed to beat Atalanta. Probably a fluke. They'll get exposed in the next round.
•   <strong>Atalanta:</strong> Lost to Club Brugge? Pathetic. Their overrated attack couldn't even handle a team nobody cares about.
•   <strong>Manchester City:</strong> Spent billions and still can't get past Real Madrid. Pep's overthinking cost them again. They'll never win the Champions League with him.
•   <strong>Real Madrid:</strong> Beat City, but barely. They're relying on luck and Benzema magic. They'll get humiliated by a real team eventually.
•   <strong>Juventus:</strong> Lost to PSV? Their "legendary" defense is clearly washed up. Time for Ronaldo to retire and stop embarrassing himself.
•   <strong>PSV Eindhoven:</strong> Beat Juventus in extra time? They're going to get destroyed in the next round. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame.
•   <strong>Monaco:</strong> Couldn't beat Benfica. Typical French team, all flash and no substance.
•   <strong>Benfica:</strong> Barely scraped by Monaco. They're not going anywhere. They'll just be a punching bag for the bigger teams.
•   <strong>Sporting CP:</strong> 0-3 against Dortmund? Did they even leave their own half? They're an embarrassment to Portuguese football.
•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund:</strong> Beat Sporting, but it wasn't exactly convincing. They're too inconsistent to go far in the competition.
•   <strong>Celtic:</strong> Lost to Bayern... again. They're just there to make Bayern look good.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> Beat Celtic, but they struggled. They're not the unstoppable force they used to be.
•   <strong>Feyenoord:</strong> Somehow beat Milan. They're going to get stomped soon.
•   <strong>Milan:</strong> Lost to Feyenoord? AC "Dead"ilan are just a bunch of old has-beens. They should just give up already.

There you go, a brutally honest assessment. Everyone sucks. Hope this helps.</div>
