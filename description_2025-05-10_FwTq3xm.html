<strong>Album Title:</strong> <em>Thriller Rager</em>

<strong>Concept:</strong> The album explores themes of paranoia, fame, and the dark side of ambition, filtered through both Jackson's classic anxieties and Scott's modern nihilism.

<strong>Tracklist:</strong>

1.  <strong>"Man in the Mirage"</strong> (3:45)

•   Features: The Weeknd (additional vocals)
•   Producers: Metro Boomin, Quincy Jones (executive production)
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Abel Tesfaye, Leland Wayne
•   Description: Opens with a haunting synth intro, layered with Jackson's signature gasps. Travis' autotuned vocals come in, distorted and frantic, describing hallucinations and a world closing in. The Weeknd provides a bridge with soaring vocals, reflecting on the emptiness of celebrity worship.
2.  <strong>"Beat It, Astro"</strong> (4:02)

•   Features: Don Toliver
•   Producers: Mike Dean, Greg Kurstin
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Caleb Zackery Toliver, Michael Dean, Greg Kurstin
•   Description: A trap-infused reimagining of "Beat It." Jackson's original vocals are chopped and screwed, mixed with heavy 808s and ad-libs from Travis. Don Toliver delivers a psychedelic, drug-induced verse about escaping reality.
3.  <strong>"P.Y.T. (Purple, Yellow, Toxic)"</strong> (3:20)

•   Features: SZA
•   Producers: WondaGurl, Teddy Riley
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Solana Imani Rowe, Ebony Oshunrinde
•   Description: A dark and sensual track. SZA channels Janet Jackson, with breathy vocals and seductive lyrics. Travis brings a drugged-out, paranoid perspective. The beat is a mix of old-school R&amp;B and modern trap, with a haunting melody.
4.  <strong>"Billie Jean's Interlude"</strong> (1:30)

•   Producers: Kanye West
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Kanye West
•   Description: A spoken-word piece. Kanye West takes a sample of Jackson's vocals from "Billie Jean" and loops it, creating a hypnotic effect. Kanye rants about the media, his own genius, and the dangers of fame. It's chaotic and unsettling.
5.  <strong>"Earth Song (Rodeo Remix)"</strong> (5:10)

•   Features: Bon Iver
•   Producers: Rick Rubin, Justin Vernon
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Justin Vernon
•   Description: A brutal deconstruction of "Earth Song." Rick Rubin strips the track down to its bare bones, while Bon Iver adds haunting harmonies. Travis raps about environmental destruction and the apocalypse, his vocals drenched in reverb and distortion. It's a bleak and hopeless vision.
6.  <strong>"Smooth Criminal (Cactus Jack Edition)"</strong> (3:55)

•   Features: 21 Savage
•   Producers: Wheezy, Quincy Jones
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph

•   Features: Playboi Carti
•   Producers: Pi'erre Bourne, Rod Temperton (posthumous)
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Jordan Terrell Carter, Rod Temperton
•   Description: The centerpiece of the album. Pi'erre Bourne creates a nightmarish soundscape, filled with distorted synths and heavy 808s. Playboi Carti's ad-libs echo through the track, creating a sense of chaos and dread. Jackson's vocals are manipulated, making him sound like a monster.
8.  <strong>"Remember the Ride"</strong> (4:20)

•   Features: Kid Cudi
•   Producers: Dot da Genius, Pharrell Williams
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi
•   Description: A surprisingly introspective track. Kid Cudi delivers a melancholic verse about addiction and mental health. The beat is mellow and atmospheric, with a focus on melody. It's a moment of vulnerability amidst the chaos.
9.  <strong>"Dirty Diana (Sirens)"</strong> (4:45)

•   Features: Rihanna
•   Producers: Boi-1da, John Barnes (posthumous)
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Robyn Rihanna Fenty
•   Description: A powerful and haunting track. Rihanna channels the raw energy of "Dirty Diana," with vocals that are both seductive and dangerous. Travis adds a layer of paranoia and anxiety.
10. <strong>"The Way You Make Me Feel (Sicko Mode)"</strong> (5:00)

•   Features: Drake
•   Producers: Tay Keith, Quincy Jones
•   Writers: Michael Jackson, Jacques Webster II, Aubrey Drake Graham
•   Description: The album's most controversial track. It’s split into multiple sections, with Travis rapping about his success and Drake delivering a scathing verse about the music industry. The beat switches multiple times, keeping the listener on edge. Jackson's vocals are sampled throughout.
11. <strong>"Leave Me Alone (Escape)"</strong> (4:10)

•   Features: James Blake

<strong>Reception:</strong>

Initially, <em>Thriller Rager</em> would be met with outrage and controversy. Many fans would be disgusted by the desecration of Jackson's legacy, while others would praise the album's bold and experimental nature. Critics would be divided, with some calling it a masterpiece of postmodern art and others dismissing it as a tasteless cash grab.

The album would be immediately targeted by the Jackson estate, who would attempt to have it removed from streaming services. Despite the controversy, <em>Thriller Rager</em> would go on to become a massive commercial success, driven by the sheer curiosity surrounding the project. It would spark countless debates about the ethics of posthumous collaborations and the boundaries of artistic expression.</div>
