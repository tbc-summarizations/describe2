  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's imagine what their conversation was like. Knowing the Beatles and their personalities, it probably went something like this:

<strong>John:</strong> "Right, Jesus, mate. We've heard you're the big man around here. What's with all the rules, eh? 'Love thy neighbor' â€“ bit much, innit? Can't we just have a laugh and get on with it?"

<strong>Jesus:</strong> (Calmly) "Love is the foundation of everything, John. It's not about rules, it's about understanding."

<strong>Paul:</strong> "Yeah, but Jesus, man, we're all about peace and love, too. 'All You Need Is Love,' remember? But sometimes, things get complicated. People don't always agree."

<strong>Jesus:</strong> "I know, Paul. That's why forgiveness is so important. We all make mistakes."

<strong>George:</strong> (Quietly) "What about the music, though? Do you dig it? We're trying to spread a message, too, you know?"

<strong>Jesus:</strong> "Music can be a powerful tool for good, George. But be careful what messages you send. Make sure they uplift people, not lead them astray."

<strong>Ringo:</strong> "So, uh, can I get an autograph?"

<strong>John:</strong> "Ringo! Get a grip. We're having a profound discussion here."

<strong>Jesus:</strong> (Smiling) "Of course, Ringo. To all of you. May your journey be filled with love, peace, and good music."

<strong>John:</strong> "Alright, cheers, Jesus. You're not as bad as the church made you out to be."</div>
