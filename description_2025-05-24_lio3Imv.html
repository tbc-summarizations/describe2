  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutally honest breakdown of that XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Kasper Schmeichel (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 7/10 - A solid keeper, but his prime is behind him. Still capable of decent performances.

â€¢   <strong>Andreas Christensen (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 7.5/10 - A decent defender, but nothing too special.

â€¢   <strong>Joakim Maehle (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 6.5/10 - Okay player, but nothing special.

â€¢   <strong>Joachim Andersen (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 6/10 - Does his job.

â€¢   <strong>Jannik Vestergaard (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 4/10 - One of the weaker ones on the list.

â€¢   <strong>Anastasios Bakasetas (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·):</strong> 5/10 - Okayish.

â€¢   <strong>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 7/10 - Does his job well, gets a lot of slack.

â€¢   <strong>Pavel Savitsky (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> 3/10 - An absolute disaster.

â€¢   <strong>Max Ebong (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> 2/10 - Not even a league 2 player.

â€¢   <strong>Andreas Skov Olsen (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 6/10 - Can be decent but is usually quite mid.

â€¢   <strong>Christian Eriksen (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°):</strong> 7.5/10 - Past his prime, but a decent player.

<strong>Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>4/10</strong> - This team is a mess. The defense is questionable, the midfield is laughably unbalanced with two very weak Belarusians, and the attack relies too heavily on a past-prime Eriksen. This team would get shredded by any decent side. The lack of quality and cohesion is glaring. A proper shambles.</div>
