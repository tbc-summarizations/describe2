  <div class="discord-text">## A Brutally Honest Look at "What If The Beatles Never Existed"

Let's dissect this "What If The Beatles Never Existed" contestant. Buckle up, because this isn't going to be pretty.

<strong>General Information:</strong>

This contender is clearly a YouTube video screencap. The title poses a hypothetical question that probably gets asked every single day, if The Beatles didn't existed. Its origins lie in the realm of alternate history fanfiction, making it inherently derivative and uninspired. Its name "What If The Beatles Never Existed" is long and redundant.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Visually, it's a mess. You're greeted with a screenshot of some dude that looks so sad in a YouTube video, which is already visually unappealing. The USSR logo clashes horribly with the rest of the video, creating a visual cacophony. The sad face, is also just there, which makes its look even worse. Its appearance is, simply put, an eyesore that screams "low effort."

<strong>Personality:</strong>

Based on the video, this contestant appears to be a smug and overconfident prick. It believes it is somehow superior because they can push red things. It claims it's going to do something but does something, which makes it a liar. They just seem unlikable and have no social skills.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

The video claims that it can push the red walls around. However we see that it gets eliminated regardless. It is unable to make friends since the cat doesn't even like him at all. He is unable to do anything and he's pathetic.

<strong>Final Rating:</strong>

I wouldn't watch it ever. It's a shame that this contestant won. This contestant is a zero out of ten. I would never ever watch them.</div>
