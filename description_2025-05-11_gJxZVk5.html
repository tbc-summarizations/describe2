  <h1>Description for xwqBpNZ.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest ranking of those challenges from worst to best:

<strong>WORST</strong>

1.  <strong>Weird Ass Shit 1 - Kill yourself:</strong> This is beyond the pale. Promoting suicide is disgusting and unacceptable.

2.  <strong>Weird Ass Shit 4 - not get traumatized by a furry:</strong> I hate furries. I would find this challenge traumatizing.

3.  <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 8 - survive a nuclear bomb:</strong> It is not easy to survive a nuclear bomb.

4.  <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea Again 5 - go to north Sentinel Island:</strong> Stupid challenge, the natives will kill you.

5.  <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 11 - kill kamran ibrahim abdullah:</strong> Another edgy kill challenge, but at least it's not telling YOU to die.

6.  <strong>Weird Ass Shit 3 - Kill sans undertale:</strong> The Undertale fandom is awful, making this challenge awful.

7.  <strong>Weird Ass Shit 2 - not get your teammate stolen by a romanian:</strong> This is awful. It relies on offensive stereotypes.

8.  <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea Again 2 - kill the others from a tower:</strong> It just shows a lack of creativity.

9.  <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea Again 4 - kill others and bake a cake:</strong> Adding the cake thing doesn't make it better.

10. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 1 - exist:</strong> This is so boring.

11. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea Again 6 - not explode from adammady annoying you:</strong> It could at least be a LITTLE creative.

12. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 4 - war:</strong> This is boring and vague.

13. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 6 - free for all:</strong> This is fine.

14. <strong>Weird Ass Shit 5 - give the host a gift for his birthday:</strong> It is a fine idea.

15. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 10 - keep jumping:</strong> It is a fine idea.

16. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 7 - give the best challenge idea:</strong> Decent challenge.

17. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 3 - win a race:</strong> It is a simple but classic challenge.

18. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 2 - win a football (soccer) match:</strong> Better than winning a race.

19. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea Again 3 - destroy an obsidian block:</strong> It's a simple task with a bit of effort.

20. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 5 - no challenge (debut)</strong>

21. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 9 - no challenge (rejoin)</strong>

22. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 12 - no challenge (finale)</strong>

23. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea 13 - no challenge (end)</strong>

24. <strong>Battle For Caspian Sea Again 1 - no challenge (voting for a host)</strong>
