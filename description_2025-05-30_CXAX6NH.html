  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get to these matchups with some brutally honest predictions:

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 vs. Georgia 🇬🇪:</strong> England will likely demolish Georgia. The gulf in quality is massive, and Georgia is honestly pathetic. I'm betting on a 5-0 victory for England. Georgia's defense will be torn to shreds.

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱 vs. Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> Poland should win comfortably. Bosnia has declined massively in recent years and is basically a pushover. Expect a 3-1 win for Poland. Lewandowski will probably score a brace.

•   <strong>Austria 🇦🇹 vs. Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> This is a slightly more competitive match, but Serbia has the better players, and Austria is a mediocre team with no real star power. I'm predicting a 2-1 win for Serbia.

•   <strong>Spain 🇪🇸 vs. Hungary 🇭🇺:</strong> Spain will dominate possession and eventually break down Hungary's defense. Hungary is a defensive team, but they won't be able to resist Spain's constant pressure. Scoreline: 3-0 to Spain.

•   <strong>Denmark 🇩🇰 vs. Ukraine 🇺🇦:</strong> A closely contested match, but Denmark is the better-organized team. Ukraine relies too much on individual brilliance, which won't be enough against a solid Danish side. I'm going with a 2-1 win for Denmark.

•   <strong>Italy 🇮🇹 vs. Czechia 🇨🇿:</strong> Italy's superior quality and tactical discipline should secure a victory. Czechia will struggle to contain Italy's attacking flair. Prediction: 3-1 for Italy.

•   <strong>Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 vs. Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> A fiercely contested match between two evenly matched sides. Scotland's home advantage might give them a slight edge. Expect a gritty 1-0 win for Scotland.

•   <strong>Belgium 🇧🇪 vs. Norway 🇳🇴:</strong> Belgium's attacking prowess will overwhelm Norway's defense. Norway is decent, but they lack the quality to compete with Belgium's world-class players. Scoreline: 4-1 to Belgium.

•   <strong>Netherlands 🇳🇱 vs. North Macedonia 🇲🇰:</strong> The Netherlands should easily triumph over North Macedonia, who are frankly quite weak. The Dutch are vastly superior in every aspect. Expect a 4-0 thrashing.

•   <strong>Iceland 🇮🇸 vs. Sweden 🇸🇪:</strong> Sweden's experience and superior squad depth will be the deciding factors in this Scandinavian clash. Iceland's glory days are long gone. I'm predicting a 2-0 win for Sweden.

•   <strong>Turkey 🇹🇷 vs. Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> This match could go either way, but I favor Turkey due to their slightly better attacking options. Greece is a defensive side, but they'll struggle to contain Turkey's forwards. Score prediction: 2-1 for Turkey.

•   <strong>Germany 🇩🇪 vs. Albania 🇦🇱:</strong> Germany will obliterate Albania. The difference in quality is astronomical, and Albania is simply outmatched in every position. Expect a 6-0 demolition.

•   <strong>Slovenia 🇸🇮 vs. Switzerland 🇨🇭:</strong> Switzerland is the stronger team with a more balanced squad. Slovenia will struggle to create chances against Switzerland's solid defense. I'm going with a 2-0 win for Switzerland.

•   <strong>Portugal 🇵🇹 vs. Slovakia 🇸🇰:</strong> Portugal, led by Ronaldo, will likely dominate Slovakia. Slovakia's defense won't be able to contain Portugal's attacking firepower. Score prediction: 3-1 to Portugal.

•   <strong>Finland 🇫🇮 vs. France 🇫🇷:</strong> France will crush Finland. The French team is packed with world-class players, and Finland simply doesn't have the quality to compete. Expect a 5-0 victory for France.

•   <strong>Romania 🇷🇴 vs. Croatia 🇭🇷:</strong> Croatia's experience and technical ability should secure a victory against a mediocre Romanian side. Romania will struggle to contain Croatia's midfield maestros. I'm predicting a 2-1 win for Croatia.</div>
