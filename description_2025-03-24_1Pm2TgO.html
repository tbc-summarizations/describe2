  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are my brutally honest predictions for the UEFA Euro 2024 quarter-finals:

•   <strong>Spain vs. Germany:</strong> Germany will bulldoze through Spain. Spain's tiki-taka is outdated. Germany's efficiency and power will make them win convincingly.

•   <strong>Portugal vs. France:</strong> France is going to humiliate Portugal. Their squad is superior across the board, and they'll exploit Portugal's defensive weaknesses mercilessly.

•   <strong>Netherlands vs. Turkey:</strong> Netherlands will be lucky to escape with a narrow win. Turkey is an overrated team, but their passion and chaos can surprise a complacent Dutch side. This will be ugly, but the Dutch will move on due to their superior talent, despite their best efforts to choke.

•   <strong>England vs. Switzerland:</strong> England will sleepwalk to victory. Switzerland is mediocre. England's media hype will continue because the Swiss offer zero threat. This will be a boring 2-0 win for England, but their fans will act like they won the World Cup.</div>
