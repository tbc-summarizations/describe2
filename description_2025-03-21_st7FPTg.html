  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's how I see the racist femboy situation in these countries:

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 7/10 - Lot of history there, a tendency for some to cling to outdated views, and a general underlying cultural conservatism makes for a somewhat racist environment, even for femboys.
•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 9/10 - Social conservatism is intense and not accepting of the LGBTQ community in general. Femboy status is not only going to make you stick out like a sore thumb but also be subjected to many discriminatory practices.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 5/10 - A mixed bag. Can be pretty progressive in some areas, but there's still a strong undercurrent of xenophobia and classism that can manifest as racism among some segments of the population. Especially online among some groups.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 6/10 - Recent history of ethnic tension, combined with a pretty conservative outlook on things, means they're not exactly winning any awards for racial inclusivity. The femboy thing is just extra fuel for the fire in some peoples' minds.
•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 8/10 - Cultural norms tend to be on the conservative side, and certain ethnic groups do face discrimination. Add to that a lack of broad LGBTQ+ acceptance, and you've got a recipe for some uncomfortable interactions.
•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 4/10 - Society, in general, is on the more lenient side. Some people in poorer areas might be homophobic but that is usually out of ignorance and has nothing to do with racism.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 8/10 - Very Conservative with strong views that are discriminatory to the LGBTQ community and they are not very accepting of the community to begin with.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 7/10 - Cultural conservatism is intense and not accepting of the LGBTQ community in general. Femboy status is not only going to make you stick out like a sore thumb but also be subjected to many discriminatory practices.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 3/10 - Very lenient and no real issues with LGBTQ members. It is mostly a safe society for femboys to be themselves.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 8/10 - Recent history of ethnic tension, combined with a pretty conservative outlook on things, means they're not exactly winning any awards for racial inclusivity. The femboy thing is just extra fuel for the fire in some peoples' minds.</div>
