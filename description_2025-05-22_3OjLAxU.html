  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this XI with brutal honesty:

<strong>Individual Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Gianluigi Donnarumma:</strong> 7/10. Talented, but his club form is inconsistent. Still a decent keeper, though.
•   <strong>Mykola Matviyenko:</strong> 5/10. Solid, but not a standout player. Likely to be targeted by better opposition.
•   <strong>Kyle Walker:</strong> 7.5/10. Veteran with pace and experience, but starting to show his age.
•   <strong>Francesco Acerbi:</strong> 6/10. Experienced, but can be a liability against pace.
•   <strong>Giovanni Di Lorenzo:</strong> 6.5/10. Reliable, but not exceptional.
•   <strong>Lorenzo Pellegrini:</strong> 7/10. Decent creativity, but can disappear in big games.
•   <strong>Davide Frattesi:</strong> 6.5/10. Energetic, but raw. Lacks top-level quality at this stage.
•   <strong>Jude Bellingham:</strong> 9/10. A world-class player. Dominant, creative, and a leader. The only reason to watch this team.
•   <strong>Declan Rice:</strong> 8/10. Excellent defensively, but limited going forward.
•   <strong>Stephan El Shaarawy:</strong> 6/10. A has-been that can have moments of brilliance but lacks the consistency needed at the highest level.
•   <strong>Giacomo Raspadori:</strong> 6/10. Promising, but not yet a proven goalscorer.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>5.5/10</strong>. This team has a few bright spots with Bellingham and Rice, but it's largely a mediocre lineup. The defense is shaky, and the attack lacks the firepower to compete against top opposition. It's a team that would struggle against any top team. The squad is more like a collection of average players sprinkled with a few stars, so they would need a masterclass coach to even play cohesively.</div>
