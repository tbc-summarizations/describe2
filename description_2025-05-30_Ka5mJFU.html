  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up because here's the unvarnished truth about this Spain squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Unai Simon:</strong> 6/10. Prone to brain farts that cost you games. Not reliable enough for a top team.
•   <strong>David Raya:</strong> 7/10. A solid shot-stopper, but lacks the commanding presence you want.
•   <strong>Alex Remiro:</strong> 5/10. Decent, but nothing special. A backup at best.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Dani Carvajal:</strong> 7/10. Getting old, but still a fighter. Can be exposed defensively.
•   <strong>Aymeric Laporte:</strong> 6/10. Overrated. Can be clumsy and lacks pace.
•   <strong>Nacho:</strong> 7/10. Versatile and dependable, but not a world-beater.
•   <strong>Pau Torres:</strong> 5/10. Too inconsistent. Makes too many errors.
•   <strong>Robin Le Normand:</strong> 6/10. Physical and decent in the air, but limited on the ball.
•   <strong>Inigo Martinez:</strong> 6/10. Aggressive and experienced, but injury-prone.
•   <strong>Marc Cucurella:</strong> 7/10. Energetic and gets forward well, but defensively suspect.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Dani Olmo:</strong> 7/10. Talented and creative, but needs to be more consistent.
•   <strong>Fabian Ruiz:</strong> 6/10. Has moments of brilliance, but often goes missing.
•   <strong>Gavi:</strong> 8/10. A young terrier with endless energy. Raw, but with huge potential.
•   <strong>Rodri:</strong> 9/10. World-class defensive midfielder. The anchor of the team.
•   <strong>Mikel Merino:</strong> 7/10. Solid and reliable, but lacks that extra spark.
•   <strong>Pedri:</strong> 9/10. A magician with the ball at his feet. Needs to stay fit.
•   <strong>Marcos Llorente:</strong> 7/10. Versatile and athletic, but lacks a defined role.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Alvaro Morata:</strong> 4/10. Misses too many chances. Not good enough for a team with ambitions.
•   <strong>Ferran Torres:</strong> 5/10. Inconsistent finisher and lacks composure in front of goal.
•   <strong>Mikel Oyarzabal:</strong> 7/10. Skilled and hard-working, but not a game-changer.
•   <strong>Isco:</strong> 6/10. Can still produce moments of magic, but too inconsistent.
•   <strong>Joselu:</strong> 5/10. A target man, but lacks the quality to trouble top defenders.
•   <strong>Nico Williams:</strong> 7/10. Exciting winger with pace and trickery. Needs to develop his end product.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

6.5/10.

<strong>Chances of Winning a Major Tournament:</strong>

•   <strong>World Cup:</strong> 15%
•   <strong>Euros:</strong> 20%
•   <strong>Nations League:</strong> 30%

<strong>Verdict:</strong>

This Spain squad is distinctly average. They have some talented midfielders in Rodri and Pedri, but are lacking in key areas. The defense is shaky, and the attack is blunt. Morata upfront is a joke – how many sitters does he need to miss to be replaced?? They're not going to win a major tournament with him leading the line. The squad is full of potential, but they lack the killer instinct, consistency, and experience to go all the way. They might get lucky and make a run in one of these tournaments, but I wouldn't bet on it.</div>
