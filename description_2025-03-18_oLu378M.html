  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are 10 likely things Mario could have seen on his phone to make him that sad:

1.  <strong>Princess Peach's OnlyFans leak:</strong> Let's be real, if she had one, it would be huge, and a leak would be catastrophic for Mario.
2.  <strong>Luigi and Daisy's secret wedding photos:</strong> Finding out his brother and the princess of Sarasaland got hitched without him would sting.
3.  <strong>Bowser's "retirement" post, revealing he's moving to a tropical island with Peach:</strong> Betrayal, pure and simple.
4.  <strong>A video of Yoshi being brutally honest about Mario's riding skills:</strong> "He's heavy, always late, and never tips with apples!"
5.  <strong>The Mushroom Kingdom's stock market crash:</strong> All his hard-earned coins, gone.
6.  <strong>An article revealing that he's actually adopted:</strong> Identity crisis incoming.
7.  <strong>A leaked script for a new game where he's replaced by a cooler, younger character:</strong> Irrelevant much?
8.  <strong>A news report that all mushrooms are now classified as toxic:</strong> No more power-ups. Game over.
9.  <strong>A deepfake video of him admitting he hates jumping:</strong> His entire career is a lie!
10. <strong>Peach announcing she's dating Donkey Kong:</strong> A power couple that leaves Mario in the dust.</div>
