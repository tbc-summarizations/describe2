  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest summary of UCL Matchday 4, with the gloves OFF:

•   <strong>PSV Eindhoven 4 - 0 Girona:</strong> Girona thought they could waltz into Eindhoven and get a result? They were slapped back to reality harder than a toddler reaching for a hot stove. PSV made them look like a bunch of amateurs. Back to the drawing board, Spanish chumps.
•   <strong>Slovan Bratislava 1 - 4 Dinamo Zagreb:</strong> Bratislava, what a disgrace. Dinamo Zagreb came to your place and put on a clinic. I'd advise that your team get better soon!
•   <strong>Bologna 0 - 1 Monaco:</strong> Bologna, you couldn't even score against Monaco? At home? Pathetic. Enjoy wallowing in your mediocrity.
•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund 1 - 0 Sturm Graz:</strong> Dortmund barely edged out Sturm Graz. Seriously? Is this the best you can do, Dortmund? You should be able to do better.
•   <strong>Celtic 3 - 1 RB Leipzig:</strong> Okay, Celtic, you finally did something right. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, it's still Leipzig.
•   <strong>Liverpool 4 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen:</strong> Liverpool destroyed Leverkusen. Time to admit that your team is not that good.
•   <strong>Lille 1 - 1 Juventus:</strong> Lille held Juventus to a draw. You should be able to beat a team like that.
•   <strong>Real Madrid 1 - 3 Milan:</strong> Real Madrid couldn't handle Milan at home? Pathetic.
•   <strong>Sporting CP 4 - 1 Manchester City:</strong> Sporting CP spanked Manchester City. Seriously.
•   <strong>Club Brugge 1 - 0 Aston Villa:</strong> Brugge beating Villa? What a snoozefest.
•   <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk 2 - 1 Young Boys:</strong> Shakhtar scraping by against Young Boys. This is Europe's elite competition, not a Sunday league!
•   <strong>Sparta Prague 1 - 2 Brest:</strong> Sparta Prague lost to Brest? You're an embarrassment to Czech football.
•   <strong>Inter Milan 1 - 0 Arsenal:</strong> Inter barely beat Arsenal. They should be able to do better
•   <strong>Feyenoord 1 - 3 Red Bull Salzburg:</strong> Feyenoord got schooled at home. Maybe stick to playing in the Eredivisie, you clearly can't handle the big boys.
•   <strong>Red Star Belgrade 2 - 5 Barcelona:</strong> Red Star Belgrade got completely slaughtered by Barcelona. Guess who should get better?
•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain 1 - 2 Atlético Madrid:</strong> PSG losing at home to Atlético Madrid? Time to consider selling your entire club and start again.
•   <strong>VfB Stuttgart 0 - 2 Atalanta:</strong> Stuttgart, you couldn't even score at home against Atalanta? You should just give up on the Champions League, clearly you're not good enough.
•   <strong>Bayern Munich 1 - 0 Benfica:</strong> Bayern with a narrow win against Benfica. You should win against a team like that.</div>
