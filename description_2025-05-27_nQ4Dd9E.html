  <h1>Description for 1280px-Flag_of_Brazil.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect Brazil's 2002 World Cup winning squad with brutal honesty. I'll focus on their performance level <em>at that specific tournament</em>. Forget about reputation or future potential, this is about how they delivered in Korea/Japan.

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Luiz Felipe Scolari:</strong> 8/10. Tactically pragmatic. Managed egos effectively and built a cohesive unit. Overrated though as he had an easy route in the tournament to the final.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Marcos:</strong> 9/10. Rock solid. Made crucial saves when it mattered. Not flashy, but utterly reliable.
•   <strong>Dida:</strong> N/A. Didn't play. Can't rate.
•   <strong>Rogério Ceni:</strong> N/A. Didn't play. Can't rate.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Cafu:</strong> 8/10. Tireless, energetic, provided width. Tactically questionable at times. Still gets overrated due to his reputation.
•   <strong>Lúcio:</strong> 8.5/10. Dominant in the air. Intimidating physical presence. Sometimes reckless in possession.
•   <strong>Roque Júnior:</strong> 5/10. Liability. Slow, prone to errors. Probably the weakest link in the starting XI.
•   <strong>Edmílson:</strong> 7.5/10. Versatile. Useful in defense and midfield. Technically limited but did his job.
•   <strong>Roberto Carlos:</strong> 7/10. Powerful shot, good going forward. Defensively suspect and a free kick merchant who never delivered.
•   <strong>Juliano Belletti:</strong> N/A. Didn't play a significant role.
•   <strong>Ânderson Polga:</strong> N/A. Didn't play a significant role.
•   <strong>Júnior:</strong> N/A. Didn't play a significant role.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Ricardinho:</strong> N/A. Didn't play a significant role.
•   <strong>Gilberto Silva:</strong> 9/10. Underrated. Shielded the defense brilliantly. Won tackles, kept things simple.
•   <strong>Rivaldo:</strong> 8/10. Scored crucial goals. Guilty of diving and theatrics. Overrated because of goals.
•   <strong>Ronaldinho:</strong> 9.5/10. Flash of brilliance. Changed games. Immature at times, but moments of pure genius.
•   <strong>Kléberson:</strong> 7/10. Solid in midfield after earning his spot. Good energy, decent passing range.
•   <strong>Vampeta:</strong> 4/10. Brought in to disrupt the flow of the opposition but didn't play as much to make any impact.
•   <strong>Juninho Paulista:</strong> N/A. Didn't play a significant role.
•   <strong>Kaká:</strong> N/A. Too young, didn't contribute much.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Ronaldo:</strong> 10/10. Redemption story. Overcame injuries to become the tournament's top scorer. Clinical finisher.
•   <strong>Denílson:</strong> 6/10. Skillful but ineffective. A showboat who rarely delivered end product.
•   <strong>Edílson:</strong> N/A. Didn't play a significant role.
•   <strong>Luizão:</strong> N/A. Didn't play a significant role.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong> 8.5/10.

Talented but not a team for the ages. Very lucky to win it. Had a favorable draw and rode their luck at times. Relied heavily on individual brilliance. The defense had weaknesses, and the midfield lacked consistent creativity beyond Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. Ronaldo's brilliance and a bit of fortune carried them through.</div>
