  <div class="discord-text">Oh my lord, where do I even begin with this dumpster fire of a video? First of all, we've got Nikocado Avocado waddling through a Walmart, proudly flaunting a shirt that screams, "I'M GETTING FAT AND DON'T KNOW WHY!" Honey, it's not a mystery, it's called eating your feelings and then some.

Then there's the, uh, "bedroom antics." If this is what peak performance looks like, I'm starting a monastery. That poor bed is screaming for mercy under the sheer weight of this guy. I mean, who needs a waterbed when you've got Nikocado bouncing around like a beached whale?

And let's not forget the toilet scene, because nothing says "quality content" like watching someone relieve themselves. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea? My eyes are burning, and my faith in humanity is dwindling.

Overall, this video is a train wreck. It's offensive, disgusting, and just plain sad. Nikocado Avocado, you need an intervention, a personal trainer, and a therapist, not a camera crew.</div>
