  <h1>Description for 10481.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, here's the brutal truth about Tobol's squad:

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Danil Ustimenko (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 5/10. Probably your starter due to being domestic, but average at best. Likely prone to mistakes.
â€¢   <strong>Sultan Busurmanov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Backup at best, probably never sees the pitch unless there's a crisis.
â€¢   <strong>Yuriy Melikhov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 2/10. Why even bother? Clearly just filling a roster spot.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Ivan Miladinovic (ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸):</strong> 6/10. Decent experience, likely a solid, if unspectacular, presence in the back.
â€¢   <strong>Temirlan Erlanov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 5/10. Serviceable, nothing more. Likely a weak link that better teams will exploit.
â€¢   <strong>Pape-Alioune Ndiaye (ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·):</strong> 4/10. Looks like a cheap foreign signing. Probably just there for the paycheck.
â€¢   <strong>Roman Asrankulov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Filling a squad spot, nothing more.
â€¢   <strong>Amanzhol Bakitzhanov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. A decent squad option, but nothing special.
â€¢   <strong>Marko Vukcevic (ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 5/10. Another medicore player, nothing special.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Ahmed El Messaoudi (ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¦):</strong> 6/10. Might be a creative spark, but Morocco's league isn't exactly world-class.
â€¢   <strong>Essien Ededem (ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¬):</strong> 4/10. Looks like another mediocre signing to just be decent.
â€¢   <strong>Askhat Tagybergen (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 7/10. Your best player so far, a must to have.
â€¢   <strong>Radoslav Tsonev (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬):</strong> 5/10. Might have a decent moment, but ultimately forgettable.
â€¢   <strong>Meyrambek Kalmyrza (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Looks like someone to fill a squad space.
â€¢   <strong>Tsotne Mosiashvili (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡ª):</strong> 4/10. Similar to the other two Kazakh players.
â€¢   <strong>Victor Braga (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·):</strong> 7/10. Another possible playmaker, but temper expectations.
â€¢   <strong>Nauryzbek Zhagorov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Filling a squad spot.
â€¢   <strong>Beybit Galym (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. Nothing special.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Aleksandr Zuev (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 6/10. Can provide some goals, but inconsistent.
â€¢   <strong>David Henen (ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¬):</strong> 5/10. Unlikely to be a game-changer.
â€¢   <strong>Zhaslan Zhumashev (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 4/10. Not a prolific scorer.
â€¢   <strong>Islam Chesnokov (ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿):</strong> 3/10. Looks bad and has no potential.
â€¢   <strong>Nikolay Signevich (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¾):</strong> 7/10. The only possible game changer and possibly a good scorer.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 5/10</strong>

Honestly, this squad looks incredibly average. Lacking any real star power or depth. This team will be battling in the middle of the pack at best. You need to invest more. Also, the team looks like it lacks any real identity or coherence. Good luck.</div>
