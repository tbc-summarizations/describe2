  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercup, because we're diving headfirst into this steaming pile of internet garbage!

First off, let's address the elephant in the room, or rather, the dog on the bench. Oh, look at Mr. Golden Retriever with his "banger tbh" thoughts. I bet his biggest life decision is whether to chase a squirrel or lick his own balls. At least he's got priorities straight. Meanwhile, the human is over here contemplating the meaning of life through the lens of social media validation. Classic.

Speaking of the human, what a sad sack. Back turned, probably scrolling through Twitter, desperately seeking validation from strangers while ignoring the majestic, soul-enriching beauty of... well, whatever dreary, overcast location they're in. Seriously, did they film this in Chernobyl? 

Let's dissect those "thought bubbles," shall we? We've got the SoundCloud logo â€“ because nothing says "existential dread" like the sound of someone's cousin rapping over a royalty-free beat. Then there's the dude with glasses. Is that supposed to be some kind of intellectual guru? Because he looks like he peaked in debate club in the 8th grade and now spends his days arguing with strangers on Reddit about the finer points of Star Wars lore.

Next, we have the dreaded Twitter bird, a symbol of fleeting dopamine hits and endless arguments with people who have cartoon avatars. It's basically a digital cesspool where common sense goes to die. And finally, Pitchfork. Oh, Pitchfork, the arbiters of musical taste for people who think liking obscure indie bands makes them interesting.

And then we have the bench's caption, "This is why the dog is happier". Yes I agree with it. This dog does not have to deal with that garbage. But I still would choose being a human over a dog any day.</div>
