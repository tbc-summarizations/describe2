  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's tear this apart.

First off, who thought it was a good idea to put sunglasses on a cat? It's not cute, it's just irritating. The cat probably hates it. And the snowflake? Really? It's like they're trying too hard to make it "quirky."

The picture quality is abysmal. It looks like it was taken with a potato. And the resolution? Don't even get me started. It's so low, I can practically count the pixels. 

The cat itself looks unimpressed, and frankly, I don't blame it. It's probably thinking, "Get these stupid glasses off me and stop taking pictures with your trash phone." 

This whole image screams "I'm trying to be funny," but it just comes off as try-hard and unoriginal. It's the kind of picture that people share in group chats thinking it's hilarious, but everyone else just silently rolls their eyes. 

Honestly, this is the kind of image that makes you question the direction humanity is heading.</div>
