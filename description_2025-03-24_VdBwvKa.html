  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest breakdown of how I see those UEFA Nations League A group stage matches playing out:

•   <strong>France vs. Italy:</strong> France will dominate. Italy's tactical rigidity will crumble against France's raw power and individual brilliance. Expect a comfortable 3-1 victory for the French.

•   <strong>Belgium vs. Israel:</strong> Belgium should win, but they'll make it harder than it needs to be. Their golden generation is aging, and complacency often creeps in. A narrow 2-1 win with some defensive lapses.

•   <strong>France vs. Belgium:</strong> This will be a tactical chess match, but France's midfield quality will ultimately prevail. Belgium's attack will struggle to break down the French defense. France wins 1-0.

•   <strong>Italy vs. Israel:</strong> Italy <em>needs</em> to win this. They'll likely park the bus and grind out a 1-0 victory, but it won't be pretty. Expect a frustrating performance with few chances created.

•   <strong>Israel vs. France:</strong> A complete mismatch. France will likely experiment with their squad, but even a second-string French team will dismantle Israel. 4-0 to France.

•   <strong>Israel vs. Belgium:</strong> Israel will fight hard, but Belgium's quality will show in the end. A 3-1 victory for Belgium.

•   <strong>Italy vs. France:</strong> Another defeat for Italy. They simply don't have the firepower to trouble France. A demoralizing 2-0 loss.

•   <strong>Belgium vs. France:</strong> Belgium will be desperate for revenge. Expect a more open and aggressive game. France will still be dominant, and win 3-1 again.

•   <strong>Israel vs. Italy:</strong> Italy will struggle to break down Israel's defense, but they'll eventually find a way through. A tense 1-0 win for Italy.

•   <strong>Israel vs. Belgium:</strong> The result is gonna be the same as the last time they play, 3-1 victory for Belgium.

•   <strong>France vs. Israel:</strong> Yet again France will be dominating, and win 4-0 again.

•   <strong>Belgium vs. Italy:</strong> Belgium will be the stronger team but Italy will still be a tough match. However, belgium would still win 2-1.

Overall, I see France dominating the group, Belgium securing second place, Italy struggling, and Israel bringing up the rear. Simple as that.</div>
