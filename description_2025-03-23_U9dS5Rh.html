  <h1>Description for image0.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Bob Dylan's use of the racial slur in "Hurricane" was intended to portray the blatant racial prejudice that Rubin "Hurricane" Carter faced during his trial. He aimed to shock the listener and expose the raw, ugly reality of the racism at the time.

Some might argue that it's still problematic to use such language, even in a critical context, but Dylan's intent was to highlight the injustice and spark outrage against a system that was clearly biased. It was a deliberate choice to use the language of the oppressors to emphasize the depth of the oppression.</div>
