  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of those countries' military power, rated on a scale of 1 to 10:

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 8/10. No joke, they're a serious military player, a nuclear power, with a strong navy and decent air force.

•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 6/10. Size matters, and Egypt has a big military. They also get a lot of hardware from different places.

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 6/10. They're modernizing fast and are strategically important. Don't underestimate them.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 5/10. They have a decent-sized military, well-equipped and mostly bought from Russia.

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 5/10. Spends a lot on defense and has capable armed forces, but resources are limited and geopolitical tensions are high.

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 4/10. They're not messing around, with their air force and army.

•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 4/10. A smaller military, but they're modernizing and focused on regional security.

•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 3/10. Geography is challenging, and they focus more on internal security and border patrol.

•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 2/10. Small and struggles with outdated equipment.

•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 2/10. Mostly relies on NATO membership for defense, but they are rapidly modernizing their equipment.</div>
