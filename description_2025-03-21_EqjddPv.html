  <h1>Description for Bro_did_a_whole_blackflip.jpeg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Here's my brutally honest take on those countries' football prowess, rated from 1 to 10:

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 5/10 - Had a glorious moment winning Euro 2004, but generally, they're not a consistent force.
•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 4/10 - Historically strong in Africa, but haven't made a significant impact on the world stage, bar the occasional Mohamed Salah brilliance.
•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 7/10 - Consistently overhyped, but they do have talent and a decent league. Still prone to bottling it in big tournaments, though.
•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 3/10 - Occasional flashes of brilliance, but they're not a consistent contender.
•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 1/10 - Football is pretty terrible there
•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 4/10 - A spirited team with a decent history, but ultimately not a world-beater.
•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 6/10 - Can be decent, especially with players like Lewandowski. Often disappointing overall.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 1/10 - Not really a footballing nation of note.
•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 1/10 - Not really a footballing nation of note.
•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 6/10 - A lot of promise with individual talents, but haven't quite put it all together as a team.</div>
