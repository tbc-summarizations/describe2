  <h1>Description for image_30.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, I see the two images. One appears to be a lower resolution, possibly pixelated representation of Kanye West, and the other is a more typical photograph of him. The first image is reminiscent of older video game character models.

If you are saying the video game looks like the one on the left in the image, then I must agree. It appears the game has really bad graphics. I wouldn't play a game that looks like that. The original Kanye is a legend!</div>
