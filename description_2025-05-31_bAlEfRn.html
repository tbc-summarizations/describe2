  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect these semi-final results with the honesty they deserve:

<strong>Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª 0-1 Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹</strong>

Belgium, the supposed "golden generation," choked again. Their inability to convert potential into actual silverware is genuinely embarrassing. Portugal, on the other hand, did what they needed to do: ground out an ugly win. They're not pretty, but they're effective, and that's all that matters. Belgium's midfield looked sluggish, their attack toothless, and their defense...well, they let Ronaldo walk all over them, need I say more? Time to blow up the Belgian squad and start fresh.

<strong>Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± 0-0 Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ (Spain wins 6-5 on penalties ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸)</strong>

A goalless draw between these two is an insult to football. The Netherlands, supposedly revitalized, were dull and uninspired. Spain, continuing their "tiki-taka of mediocrity," dominated possession but created nothing of note. Penalties, the ultimate test of nerve and skill, went Spain's way, but it barely masks the fact that they're a shadow of their former selves. Both teams should be ashamed of their performances. They need a serious injection of creativity and a willingness to actually attack.

In short, these semi-finals were a disappointment. Two mediocre matches, one predictable result, and one penalty shootout. The final is going to be the same, unless something drastic changes, my expectations are low.</div>
