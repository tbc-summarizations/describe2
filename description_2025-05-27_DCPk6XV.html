  <h1>Description for 16779.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of this Ordabasy squad. I'm not holding back.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Bekkhan Shaizada:</strong> Decent for a local keeper, probably does the basics. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Dumitru Celeadnic:</strong> Likely brought in to add some perceived "international" flair. Probably not much better than Shaizada. <strong>5.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Aydos Kemaladin:</strong> A complete unknown. Probably a youth product filling a spot. <strong>4/10</strong>

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Sergey Malyi:</strong> Probably the most reliable defender. Not amazing, but experienced. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Victor Mudrac:</strong> Another Moldovan. Probably nothing special if he's playing in Kazakhstan. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Ular Zhaksybaev:</strong> Sounds like a squad filler. Likely prone to errors. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Nikola Antic:</strong> Serbian so he is their best player likely, decent passing range. <strong>6.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sherif Jimoh:</strong> Could be decent, or a complete liability. Coin flip. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sagadat Tursynbay:</strong> Another Kazakh. Probably just happy to be there. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Sultanbek Astanov:</strong> Youth player, nothing more. <strong>3/10</strong>

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Dario Canadjija:</strong> Croatian, so probably has some technical ability. Potential for being the midfield playmaker. <strong>6.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Zhasulan Amir:</strong> Local player, probably average at best. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Murodzhon Khalmatov:</strong> A complete unknown quantity, probably a squad player. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Rashid Abubakar:</strong> Ghanaian. Another coin flip player. Could be decent defensively. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Vyacheslav Shvyrev:</strong> Typical Kazakh midfielder. Probably doesn't stand out. <strong>5/10</strong>

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Luka Imnadze:</strong> Georgian. Could have some flair, but likely inconsistent. <strong>5.5/10</strong>
•   <strong>João Paulino:</strong> From Cape Verde. Might have some pace, but probably lacks end product. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Erkebulan Tungyshbaev:</strong> Local striker. Probably not a prolific goal scorer. <strong>4/10</strong>
•   <strong>Zikrillo Sultaniyazov:</strong> Another Kazakh striker. Probably just happy to be on the team. <strong>3/10</strong>
•   <strong>Kayode Saliman:</strong> Nigerian. Could be the one to watch, or a complete flop. <strong>5/10</strong>
•   <strong>Everton Moraes:</strong> Brazilian. Has potential to be exciting, but likely overrated. <strong>6/10</strong>
•   <strong>Bagdaulet Nuraly:</strong> Yet another Kazakh. Probably a benchwarmer. <strong>3/10</strong>

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

Honestly, this squad looks pretty mediocre. It's a mix of unproven foreigners, average locals, and youth players. There might be a few players with potential, but overall, it's not a squad that inspires much confidence. They might fight for a mid-table finish in Kazakhstan, but that's about it.

<strong>Overall squad rating: 4.5/10</strong></div>
