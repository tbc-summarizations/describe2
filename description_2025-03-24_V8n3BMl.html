  <div class="discord-text">(Verse 1)
Behold, a feline on a stick, a bizarre sight to behold,
Like some demented county fair, a story to be told.
A cat-shaped corn dog, dripping with neon goo,
Held in a hand that's seen some shit, that much is plainly true.

(Chorus)
Oh, cat on a stick, what have you done?
Twisted my mind, 'til day is done.
A fever dream, a psychedelic mess,
This culinary feline, I must confess,
Is the dumbest thing, I've ever seen.

(Verse 2)
Those vacant, electric-blue eyes, staring through the glaze,
A melted visage, lost in a colorful haze.
What poor artist thought this up, what drugs were in the mix?
A mockery of felines, a visual heart attack, a cruel fix.

(Chorus)
Oh, cat on a stick, what have you done?
Twisted my mind, 'til day is done.
A fever dream, a psychedelic mess,
This culinary feline, I must confess,
Is the dumbest thing, I've ever seen.

(Bridge)
The background swirls, a chaotic spree,
Complementing the absurdity,
No taste or thought, just visual noise,
A picture of failure, mocking all my joys.

(Chorus)
Oh, cat on a stick, what have you done?
Twisted my mind, 'til day is done.
A fever dream, a psychedelic mess,
This culinary feline, I must confess,
Is the dumbest thing, I've ever seen.

(Outro)
So let this be a warning, a tale for one and all,
Some things are best left unmade, lest sanity should fall.
A cat on a stick, a symbol of decline,
The moment art and food collided, and then just died.</div>
