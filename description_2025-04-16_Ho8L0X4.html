  <h1>Description for BattleForNiggas3.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because we're diving into the trainwreck that is Coconut Elephant.

<strong>General Information</strong>

Coconut Elephant seems to be an unnamed contestant from the "Battle For Nirrous!" object show, judging by the grid. It is represented by an image of an elephant with a coconut crudely photoshopped onto its butt. I'm guessing it's supposed to be funny, but it mostly lands with a thud.

<strong>External Appearance</strong>

Let's be real, it's a disaster. We have a realistic-looking elephant cut in half. The back of the elephant has the inside of a coconut photoshopped into it. The execution is lazy and not particularly humorous. 

<strong>Personality</strong>

There's nothing there. We get a blank canvas. You can't even guess what Coconut Elephant is like, because all there is for him is just a bad edit of an image of an elephant with a coconut. Is it quirky? Is it intelligent? Is it a complete sociopath? Who knows!

<strong>Abilities</strong>

Due to the lack of character development, Coconut Elephant has absolutely no confirmed skills. I'm assuming its primary ability is to be a glorified coconut-themed paperweight.

<strong>Rating</strong>

My rating for Coconut Elephant is a solid 1/10. No personality, no development, and the design looks horrible. Honestly, they could just have chosen literally any other object, even if you don't find any personality in it, it'll still at least be a nice image or character design.</div>
