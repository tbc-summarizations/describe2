  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of this XI:

<strong>Individual Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Łukasz Skorupski:</strong> 5. He's a decent keeper but nothing special. Solid Serie A player but not world-class.

•   <strong>Matty Cash:</strong> 6.5. He's got some attacking flair and is decent defensively, but can be inconsistent.

•   <strong>Arlind Ajeti:</strong> 3. He's had a journeyman career. Honestly, he's a weak link in this lineup.

•   <strong>Jakub Kiwior:</strong> 6. Still fairly young but he plays for Arsenal so he must be decent.

•   <strong>Vladimír Coufal:</strong> 6. A hard-working player. Not the most technically gifted, but puts in a shift.

•   <strong>Piotr Zieliński:</strong> 7.5. A creative midfielder with good technical ability. Can be a real threat on his day.

•   <strong>Sebastian Szymański:</strong> 6. A decent midfielder.

•   <strong>Tomáš Souček:</strong> 7. He's a physical presence and good in the air. Adds steel to the midfield.

•   <strong>Antonín Barák:</strong> 7. A good player but very incosistent.

•   <strong>Robert Lewandowski:</strong> 9.5. One of the best strikers of his generation. Still a goal machine.

•   <strong>Krzysztof Piątek:</strong> 5. Has moments of brilliance, but often disappears in games. Not reliable enough.

<strong>Team Rating (out of 10):</strong>

<strong>5.5.</strong> This team is heavily reliant on Lewandowski for goals and Zieliński for creativity. The defense looks shaky with Ajeti, and there's a lack of balance in midfield. It's a squad with some quality individuals but a glaring lack of overall cohesion and defensive strength. I honestly think they have no chance against a slightly better side.</div>
