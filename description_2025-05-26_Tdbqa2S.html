  <h1>Description for 1024px-UEFA_Champions_League.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to unleash the roast of the century on these so-called "Champions League" teams:

•   <strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> Ah, PSG, perpetually choking in Europe. They barely scraped by against Liverpool, needing penalties to cover up their pathetic performances. Nasser Al-Khelaifi must be fuming that they can't just buy their way to a Champions League trophy.

•   <strong>Club Brugge:</strong> Absolutely demolished by Aston Villa. They got their asses whooped so bad.

•   <strong>Real Madrid:</strong> Grinding out a penalty win against Atletico Madrid. Can't they do better than that?

•   <strong>PSV Eindhoven:</strong> 9 goals! Seriously? At home? Is Arsenal only good at playing against teams from Netherlands?

•   <strong>Benfica:</strong> You're Benfica, what did you expect? The fact you even made it this far is a miracle.

•   <strong>Borussia Dortmund:</strong> Barely scraping past Lille, in a competition where PSG played. This is a fluke if I have ever seen one.

•   <strong>Bayern Munich:</strong> Decimating Bayer Leverkusen? So dominant they barely had to break a sweat. Thomas Tuchel is the man.

•   <strong>Feyenoord:</strong> Oh Feyenoord, what a pity. Absolutely destroyed by Inter. I bet they are so sad they came all the way here only to be destroyed.

There you have it. I hope this was brutal enough for you.</div>
