  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest assessment of the Fulham squad, individually and as a whole:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Marco Silva 🇵🇹:</strong> 6/10. He's tactically sound, but tends to crumble under pressure and doesn't have a consistent plan B. His stubbornness is a serious liability.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Bernd Leno 🇩🇪:</strong> 7/10. Solid shot-stopper, but prone to occasional brain farts. A decent Premier League keeper, but not world-class.
•   <strong>Steven-Andreas Benda 🇩🇪:</strong> 3/10. A backup who will likely never see meaningful game time. Probably not Premier League quality.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Timothy Castagne 🇧🇪:</strong> 7/10. A dependable, no-nonsense defender. Not flashy, but gets the job done.
•   <strong>Kenny Tete 🇳🇱:</strong> 6/10. Decent, but lacks the pace and agility to consistently deal with top-tier wingers.
•   <strong>Joachim Andersen 🇩🇰:</strong> 7/10. Good on the ball, but can be bullied physically. Susceptible to defensive lapses in concentration.
•   <strong>Issa Diop 🇫🇷:</strong> 5/10. Prone to errors and lacks the composure needed at this level.
•   <strong>Jorge Cuenca 🇪🇸:</strong> 4/10. A squad player at best. Likely not good enough for regular Premier League action.
•   <strong>Calvin Bassey 🇳🇬:</strong> 6/10. Athletic and has potential, but raw and makes too many mistakes.
•   <strong>Antonee Robinson 🇺🇸:</strong> 7/10. Energetic and offers good width, but his final product in attack is often lacking.
•   <strong>Ryan Sessegnon 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 4/10. Injury-prone and hasn't lived up to the hype. Seems destined to be a perennial disappointment.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Harrison Reed 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 5/10. A hard worker, but limited in terms of technical ability. A squad player.
•   <strong>Sander Berge 🇳🇴:</strong> 7/10. A decent holding midfielder. Nothing more.
•   <strong>Sasa Lukic 🇷🇸:</strong> 6/10. A decent, unspectacular midfielder. Lacks the creativity to unlock defenses.
•   <strong>Andreas Pereira 🇧🇷:</strong> 6/10. Capable of moments of brilliance, but wildly inconsistent.
•   <strong>Joshua King 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 3/10. Clearly past his prime and a shadow of his former self. Doesn't deserve to be on the team.
•   <strong>Tom Cairney 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿:</strong> 5/10. Slow and lacks the physicality to compete in the Premier League. A nostalgia pick.
•   <strong>Emile Smith Rowe 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 7/10. Shows promise, but too injury prone. 

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Adama Traore 🇪🇸:</strong> 5/10. All pace and no end product. A frustrating player to watch.
•   <strong>Harry Wilson 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿:</strong> 6/10. Can score goals, but lacks consistency and is easily marked out of games.
•   <strong>Willian 🇧🇷:</strong> 6/10. Getting old, but still has flashes of quality. However, his best days are long gone.
•   <strong>Alex Iwobi 🇳🇬:</strong> 5/10. Inconsistent and frustrating. Offers little impact for the team.
•   <strong>Reiss Nelson 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 4/10. Not Premier League quality. Lacks the talent and composure to make an impact.
•   <strong>Martial Godo 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 3/10. Far too early to rate.
•   <strong>Raul Jimenez 🇲🇽:</strong> 5/10. A shadow of his former self after his injury. Lacks pace and sharpness.
•   <strong>Carlos Vinicius 🇧🇷:</strong> 4/10. A glorified target man who offers little else.
•   <strong>Rodrigo Muniz 🇧🇷:</strong> 4/10. Raw and unproven at this level.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

•   <strong>5/10.</strong> This is a deeply mediocre squad with glaring weaknesses in key positions. They lack creativity, defensive solidity, and a reliable goalscorer. Fulham will be fighting relegation all season. They are only better than a handful of other teams that are in a horrible situation.</div>
