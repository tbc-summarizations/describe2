  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this pathetic European Swiss system tournament apart.

<strong>3W 1L (The Winner Will Advance to the Knockout Round):</strong>

•   <strong>Turkey (0) - Netherlands (1):</strong> Turkey, are you even trying? Zero goals? Pathetic. Get out of the kitchen. Netherlands, barely scraping by, but at least you can hit the back of the net.

•   <strong>France (0) - Portugal (1):</strong> France, what a disgrace. Zero creativity, zero fight. Portugal, you're not much better, but at least you capitalized on France's incompetence.

•   <strong>Switzerland (1) - Italy (2):</strong> Switzerland, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Close, but no cigar. Italy, predictable but effective. Not impressive.

•   <strong>Hungary (1) - Wales (0):</strong> Wales, you're just sad. Hungary, you barely managed to beat a team of sheep farmers.

<strong>1W 3L (The Loser Will Be Eliminated):</strong>

•   <strong>Poland (2) - Scotland (1):</strong> Poland, you're barely above average. Scotland, pack your bags and head home.

•   <strong>Albania (0) - Norway (2):</strong> Albania, zero goals? How embarrassing. Norway, you beat a team of amateurs.

•   <strong>Georgia (0) - Greece (0) (Georgia wins 5-4 on penalties):</strong> What a snooze fest. Zero goals for 120 minutes? Both teams should be ashamed. Georgia, congrats on winning the penalty lottery.

•   <strong>Serbia (3) - Bosnia (1):</strong> Serbia, finally showing some dominance. Bosnia, better luck next time.

Overall, this tournament is a joke. These teams need to step up their game or just stay home and watch from their TVs.</div>
