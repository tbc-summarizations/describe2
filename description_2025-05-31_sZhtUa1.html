  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here are my brutally honest predictions for these quarter-final matches:

<strong>Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ vs. Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Belgium 4 - Switzerland 0
â€¢   <strong>Detailed Brutality:</strong> Switzerland is going to get steamrolled. They might put up a decent defensive effort for a while, but Belgium's attacking power is just too much. Switzerland lacks the creativity and finishing ability to truly threaten Belgium's defense, and their midfield will be completely outclassed. Expect a comfortable win for Belgium, with a late goal sealing Switzerland's humiliation.

<strong>Hungary ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º vs. Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Portugal 3 - Hungary 1
â€¢   <strong>Detailed Brutality:</strong> Hungary had a good run, but it ends here. Portugal, with all their experience and individual brilliance, will be too much for them. Hungary's defense is shaky, and they will struggle to contain Portugal's attack. Portugal will control the midfield, dictate the pace, and eventually break down Hungary's resistance. Hungary might get a consolation goal, but it won't change the outcome.

<strong>Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ vs. Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Italy 2 - Netherlands 1 (AET)
â€¢   <strong>Detailed Brutality:</strong> This will be the tightest match of the round. Both teams are well-organized and tactically astute, but Italy has the edge in experience and defensive solidity. The Netherlands will struggle to break down Italy's defense, and Italy's counter-attacks will be deadly. Expect a tense, cagey affair that goes to extra time. Italy will eventually find a winner, breaking Dutch hearts.

<strong>France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· vs. Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Prediction:</strong> France 3 - Spain 0
â€¢   <strong>Detailed Brutality:</strong> France is going to absolutely dismantle Spain. Spain's tiki-taka style is outdated and ineffective against a well-organized and athletic French team. France's midfield will dominate, their attackers will run riot, and their defense will suffocate Spain's creativity. Expect a comprehensive victory for France, leaving Spain questioning their entire footballing philosophy.

There you have it. A brutally honest assessment of what I think will happen. No holding back.</div>
