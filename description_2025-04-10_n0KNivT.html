  <h1>Description for lv_0_20250406203535_1_1.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I'd rank those characters from worst to best, no holds barred:

13.  <strong>Azerbaijan</strong>: That prick got joy out of the elimination, seemed to enjoy being a massive instigator, and was the first to be eliminated. 
14.   <strong>Armenia</strong>: Zero votes, completely irrelevant, and gone almost instantly. A waste of space.
15.   <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>: Just as useless as Armenia. Disappeared without a trace.
16.  <strong>Turkey</strong>: Followed through with killing a contestant that made them. What a hypocrite!
17.  <strong>Georgia</strong>: This backstabber just was following the tides in the end.
18.  <strong>Iraq</strong>: At least he wasn't completely useless, but mostly boring, and couldn't deliver when it counted.
19.   <strong>Iran</strong>: Took a stand against the worst people, but ultimately a weak fighter.
20.   <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>: Mediocre. Took the easy way out and was easily intimidated.
21.  <strong>IShowSpeed:</strong> A clown and doesnâ€™t need to be in it. 
22.   <strong>Kamran Ibrahim Abdullah</strong>: He wants to take what's already the characters' time. Very selfish! 
23.   <strong>Uami Bosim</strong>: Yeah, he's a dick with his eliminations and cruel jokes. Still, he makes for an entertaining host, even if he's a complete jerk.</div>
