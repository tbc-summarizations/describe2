  <h1>Description for 1024px-Manchester_City_FC_badge.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the Manchester City squad, player by player and as a whole:

<strong>Coach:</strong>

•   <strong>Pep Guardiola:</strong> 10/10. Tactically brilliant, proven winner, elevates players. No debate.

<strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>

•   <strong>Scott Carson:</strong> 2/10. A mascot at this point, not a serious contender.
•   <strong>Stefan Ortega:</strong> 7/10. Solid backup, reliable when called upon, but not world-class.
•   <strong>Ederson Moraes:</strong> 8/10. Excellent shot-stopper, great distribution, but prone to occasional brain farts.

<strong>Defenders:</strong>

•   <strong>Matheus Nunes:</strong> 6/10. Decent, but hasn't fully justified the price tag. Needs to show more.
•   <strong>Rico Lewis:</strong> 7/10. Promising youngster, versatile, but still raw and needs development.
•   <strong>John Stones:</strong> 8/10. Class act when fit, but injury-prone. Intelligent and composed.
•   <strong>Nathan Ake:</strong> 7/10. Reliable, versatile, but not a game-changer. Solid squad player.
•   <strong>Manuel Akanji:</strong> 7/10. Good on the ball, decent pace, but can be exposed defensively.
•   <strong>Ruben Dias:</strong> 9/10. Leader, rock-solid defender, great in the air. Essential.
•   <strong>Abdukodir Khusanov:</strong> 3/10. Too inexperienced to make a serious impact.
•   <strong>Jahmai Simpson-Pusey:</strong> 3/10. Not ready for this level.
•   <strong>Vitor Reis:</strong> 4/10. Needs a lot of work.
•   <strong>Josko Gvardiol:</strong> 8/10. Talented, but hasn't lived up to the hype yet. Needs to find his best position.
•   <strong>Christian McFarlane:</strong> 2/10. Too raw to be considered.
•   <strong>Nico O'Reilly:</strong> 3/10. Another academy product who isn't ready.

<strong>Midfielders:</strong>

•   <strong>Ilkay Gundogan:</strong> 9/10 (Past player, but still relevant to the squad's legacy). Consistent, intelligent, scores crucial goals.
•   <strong>Mateo Kovacic:</strong> 7/10. Good technician, but not as impactful as Gundogan.
•   <strong>Rodri:</strong> 9/10. World-class defensive midfielder, dictates play, crucial for the team's balance.
•   <strong>Nico Gonzalez:</strong> 5/10. Not at the level required.
•   <strong>Kevin De Bruyne:</strong> 10/10. One of the best midfielders in the world, incredible passing range, vision, and creativity (when fit).
•   <strong>James McAtee:</strong> 6/10. Showing promise, but needs more consistent playing time.
•   <strong>Claudio Echeverri:</strong> 5/10. Too young to be a factor yet.
•   <strong>Phil Foden:</strong> 9/10. Versatile, talented, scores important goals, but needs to be more consistent.

<strong>Attackers:</strong>

•   <strong>Bernardo Silva:</strong> 9/10. Technically gifted, tireless worker, intelligent player.
•   <strong>Oscar Bobb:</strong> 7/10. Bright young talent, exciting to watch.
•   <strong>Savinho:</strong> 6/10. Has potential, but needs to be more clinical.
•   <strong>Jack Grealish:</strong> 7/10. Good dribbler, draws fouls, but lacks end product at times.
•   <strong>Jeremy Doku:</strong> 8/10. Direct, explosive, exciting winger.
•   <strong>Erling Haaland:</strong> 10/10. Goal machine, clinical finisher, unstoppable force.
•   <strong>Omar Marmoush:</strong> 5/10. Not good enough for this team.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating:</strong>

9/10.

Despite the couple of bad players, this squad is stacked with world-class talent and has the best manager in the world. They're favorites to win every competition they enter. The only reason it's not a perfect 10 is due to the fact that the defence isn't as good as it used to be when it was just Dias and Stones with Cancelo and Walker.</div>
