  <h1>Description for BattleForNiggas3.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I see these characters, ranked from worst to best, holding nothing back:

1.  <strong>Black Hole</strong> - What a trash character. The idea is overused, boring, and it couldn't even pull off a decent villain.
2.  <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin</strong> - Pathetic design. Looks like something a toddler would draw.
3.  <strong>Goblin</strong> - A face that screams "I peaked in high school." Irrelevant and uninteresting.
4.  <strong>Face</strong> - Too simple, too lazy. Basic shapes slapped together, not even trying.
5.  <strong>Coconut Elephant</strong> - The creator got lazy, like it even makes sense.
6.  <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed</strong> - A YouTube thumbnail? Really? This is the best you can do? At least it can attack with guns.
7.  <strong>Cow From Minecraft</strong> - Blocky, dull, and as interesting as watching grass grow.
8.  <strong>Evil Venus</strong> - Too generic to even hate properly. 
9. <strong>This Fucking Cat</strong> - Not even trying to be a real character. 
10. <strong>Stop Breathing</strong> - Not even a character, its just a tiktok screenshot.
11. <strong>Cold Cow</strong> - Now here is a worthy character. I love their design and backstory! The only one who stopped black hole!
12. <strong>Kanye West</strong> - Okay, I'll admit, he got annoying after a while, with the Trump hats. But even with all that drama, he still has more charisma than most of the characters in this list.
13. <strong>Aldi</strong> - At least it's actually a brand, which is why it is better than most of the others.
14. <strong>Al Gore</strong> - Love Al Gore. He does not care about these other characters at all and will just win! I like his design too.</div>
