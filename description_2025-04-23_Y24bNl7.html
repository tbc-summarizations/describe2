  <h1>Description for 8mb.video-4sU-aB9prmhS.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to lay down some hard truths. Here's my brutally honest ranking from worst to best, no holding back:

21.  <strong>Atomic Bomb</strong>: Literally nothing good can come from this. Zero entertainment value, just mass destruction.
22.  <strong>AK-47</strong>: Another instrument of death. There's no redeeming quality, just violence.
23.  <strong>Plunger:</strong> A birthday cake? really, that's not even good.
24.  <strong>Stop Breathing</strong>: What kind of name is that?
25.  <strong>Face</strong>: This character doesn't really seem like a "character" at all, its just a smile, there is no effort.
26. <strong>Cold Cow</strong>: Not the best item to have.
27.  <strong>Evil Venus</strong>: What a weird name.
28.  <strong>Grappling Hook</strong>: Pointless. 
29.  <strong>Cow From Minecraft</strong>: At least it looks cool.
30.  <strong>Strawberry Meeth's Cousin</strong>: What is that.
31.  <strong>Kanye West</strong>: Even his own album is absolute dogshit.
32.  <strong>What If The Beatles Never Existed?</strong>: Another dumb name.
33.  <strong>Goblin</strong>: Has a good name, but it's not that interesting.
34.  <strong>Aldi</strong>: There is not much to comment on.
35. <strong>Black Hole</strong>: It's pretty cool but not amazing.
36.  <strong>Alex Newtron</strong>: I kinda enjoyed the music.
37.  <strong>Steak</strong>: Honestly, steak is a pretty decent gift. Nothing groundbreaking, but I can't hate on it too much.
38.  <strong>Fucking Cat</strong>: I'm not really into cats, but a whole pool of food is awesome.
39.  <strong>Gato De Naranjas</strong>: This has a lot of effort put into it.
40.  <strong>Coconut Elephant</strong>: A very unique thing.
41.  <strong>Al Gore</strong>: He has a lot of personality and makes this whole thing so much better.</div>
