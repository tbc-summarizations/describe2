  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest rating of each player and the team overall:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong>
•   <strong>Unai Simon (Spain):</strong> 5/10. Goalkeeping in modern football is not only about saving shots, it is about distribution and his is atrocious. If not for the fact Spain won the competition, he would be lower.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>
•   <strong>Theo Hernandez (France):</strong> 7/10. One goal and one assist isn't particularly high considering his position. If not for the fact that the competition allows for 4 defenders, I would not chose him.
•   <strong>David Raum (Germany):</strong> 8/10. One goal and three assists is a good number to have for any defender.
•   <strong>Nacho (Spain):</strong> 7/10. Scoring two goals as a defender is a decent number, especially since he didn't assist anyone.
•   <strong>Nicusor Bancu (Romania):</strong> 7/10. One goal and one assist as a defender is decent.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   <strong>Leon Goretzka (Germany):</strong> 9/10. Two goals and four assists in the midfield is exceptional.
•   <strong>Fabian Ruiz (Spain):</strong> 7/10. One goal and three assists is good.
•   <strong>Kevin De Bruyne (Belgium):</strong> 8/10. Two goals and two assists are good for a midfielder. I do think he could've done more considering his capability.
•   <strong>Bernardo Silva (Portugal):</strong> 8/10. Three goals and one assist is very good. He should have more assists considering his position.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>
•   <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal):</strong> 9/10. MVP of the tournament is quite a big achievement, his ability to score goals speaks for itself.
•   <strong>Romelu Lukaku (Belgium):</strong> 10/10. He is the highest goalscorer of the tournament with eight goals and one assist.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

•   <strong>Total Team Rating: 7/10.</strong> The team is solid overall. They had good stats but it is no way the best of the best. They should have performed better statistically as individuals.</div>
