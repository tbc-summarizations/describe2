  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down these matches and rank them on the epic scale, brutally honest as requested:

1.  <strong>Astana 4 - 3 Celtic:</strong> This is the top tier of epic. A seven-goal thriller with goals flying in throughout the match. The back-and-forth nature, with late goals determining the outcome, screams drama. Definitely a must-watch, edge-of-your-seat type of game. The goalscorers spread throughout the match make it even more intense.

2.  <strong>Astana 2 - 2 Galatasaray:</strong> A draw, but a high-scoring one with own goals and late drama in the final minutes. Both teams were evenly matched, resulting in an intense battle until the final whistle.

3.  <strong>Astana 2 - 1 Manchester United:</strong> Any game where Man U loses is inherently entertaining, but a late goal making the difference elevates it. The sheer contrast between the clubs and the upset potential amplifies the epicness.

4.  <strong>Astana (4) - (0) Unknown Team:</strong> A game in the 52nd minute, a blowout by Astana.

5.  <strong>Astana 3 - 1 Legia:</strong> A solid win, but not as many goals. Probably a relatively comfortable victory for Astana. Not too much drama, but a decent game.

6.  <strong>Astana 2 - 0 Stade Rennais:</strong> It's a clean win, but 2-0 isn't the most thrilling scoreline. Lacks the goals and back-and-forth action to be truly epic.

7.  <strong>Astana 1 - 1 Olympiacos:</strong> A draw with not many goals.

8.  <strong>Astana 1 - 0 CFR 1907 Cluj:</strong> Close match, but the low score of 1-0 is not as epic.

9.  <strong>Astana 0 - 0 Atletico Madrid:</strong> A goalless draw can be a tactical masterclass or an utter bore. Knowing Atletico's style, it was probably a defensive slog. Definitely the least epic of the bunch.</div>
