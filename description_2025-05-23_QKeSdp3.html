  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are my brutally honest predictions for the Balkan Cup quarter-finals, with aggregate scorelines:

â€¢   <strong>Croatia ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡· vs. Serbia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸</strong>: Croatia 4 - 2 Serbia. Croatia's got a better overall team. Serbia may have the talent but they don't have the discipline. Expect fireworks and a few red cards in this one, but ultimately Croatia's superior quality will see them through.
â€¢   <strong>North Macedonia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡° vs. Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·</strong>: North Macedonia 1 - 5 Turkey. Turkey will absolutely smash North Macedonia, they will get completely outplayed and the match will be over before half time. They don't stand a chance.

â€¢   <strong>Montenegro ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ª vs. Romania ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´</strong>: Montenegro 0 - 3 Romania. Both are rather mediocre teams, but Romania have a slightly better edge, will not be a great match.

â€¢   <strong>Greece ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· vs. Slovenia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡®</strong>: Greece 1 - 0 Slovenia. Greece are overall more consistent at the back than Slovenia and thus should edge this match out.</div>
