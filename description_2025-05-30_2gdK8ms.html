  <div class="discord-text"><strong>Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª vs. Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª (0-1)</strong>

Germany? More like Germ-ANYTHING-BUT-GOOD in this match. Seriously, did they even show up? It's like they were so busy perfecting their lederhosen that they forgot they had a soccer game to play. Belgium, on the other hand, must have sprinkled some waffles with goal-scoring dust. At least one of them did.

<strong>Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ vs. Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ (0-2)</strong>

Switzerland thought they could yodel their way to victory? Spain must have been laughing so hard they scored two goals out of pity. Switzerland, better stick to making watches and chocolate; soccer is clearly not in their skillset. Spain played a solid game, but let's be honest, they were up against a team that couldn't decide if they wanted to play soccer or ski down a mountain.</div>
