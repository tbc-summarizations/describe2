  <h1>Description for progress-pride-2021.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercups, because we're about to dive headfirst into a dumpster fire of a flag and I'm not pulling any punches. What in the actual rainbow-vomit is this monstrosity? Did someone raid a kindergarten's craft bin and then decided to staple it all together?

First off, the yellow triangle with the sad little purple circle. It looks like a deflated sun that's been crying because it realized it's part of this mess. The purple circle? Looks like it's trying to escape but it's too late. It's trapped in the land of awful design choices forever.

And then we have the "inclusive" chevron of sadness. Brown and black? Seriously? Did we run out of colors or did someone just spill their coffee and decide to leave it in? It looks like a chocolate milkshake exploded in a pastel shop, leaving us with this bizarre, muddy attempt at representation.

And don't even get me STARTED on the classic rainbow stripes. Oh, you thought you could salvage this disaster by slapping on the tried-and-true symbol of gay pride? Nope. It's like putting a band-aid on a severed limb.

This flag looks like it was designed by a committee of colorblind toddlers on a sugar rush. It's a visual assault on the eyes, a monument to over-inclusivity gone wrong, and a testament to the fact that sometimes, less is more.

If this flag was a meal, it would be a plate of week-old leftovers served with a side of expired mayonnaise and a hair. If it was a song, it would be nails on a chalkboard played at 3 AM. If it was a pet, it would be a rabid chihuahua with fleas.

In conclusion, this flag is a goddamn abomination. Burn it. Bury it. Forget it ever existed. Let's just stick with the classic rainbow and call it a day. For the love of all that is holy, no more flags designed by committee.</div>
