  <h1>Description for 6HdhjV0.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because these profile pics are about to get demolished:

•   <strong>The red block:</strong> Looks like someone just discovered MS Paint. Simplicity is cool, but this is just lazy.
•   <strong>Camel:</strong> probably racist.
•   <strong>Green Thing with Hat:</strong> Bro thinks he's cool with that hat, but he just looks like a lost tourist.
•   <strong>Pillow:</strong> You know what? This one has a sense of humor. Decent choice.
•   <strong>Moon:</strong> Emo kid still stuck in 2008. Get over yourself.
•   <strong>Falling Person:</strong> Trying way too hard to be deep. We get it, you're "unique."
•   <strong>Stick Figure:</strong> Basic. You're either a child or have the artistic skills of one.
•   <strong>Red Circle Thing:</strong> At least try to be original, kid.
•   <strong>Tennis Ball:</strong> So you're into sports? Groundbreaking.
•   <strong>Purple Hair:</strong> Trying to be anime? Cringe.
•   <strong>Blue Thing:</strong> Looks like a rejected character from a children's show.
•   <strong>Weird Green Head:</strong> I bet you have a fedora.
•   <strong>Orange Thing:</strong> Desperate for attention.
•   <strong>Crying Moon:</strong> Get a grip, crybaby.
•   <strong>Bubble:</strong> At least it's aesthetically pleasing, but still a little boring.
•   <strong>Pillow:</strong> Again, solid choice.
•   <strong>Taco thingy:</strong> Taco Bell is your favorite restaurant, isn't it?
•   <strong>Blocky:</strong> Still ugly.
•   <strong>Funny Studious:</strong> You think you're funny? I bet you smell funny.
•   <strong>Cake thingy:</strong> Get better pfps!
•   <strong>Green Ball:</strong> Your jokes are probably as bad as your taste in profile pictures.
•   <strong>Happy Man:</strong> I bet your name is Kyle.
•   <strong>Pillow:</strong> Now you're just being repetitive.

•   <strong>Taiwan + Tower:</strong> A bit too patriotic. We get it, you love your country, but tone it down.
•   <strong>Goldfish:</strong> Bland and uninspired. Just like your personality.
•   <strong>Red Thing:</strong> You're probably a huge nerd.
•   <strong>Pillow:</strong> Fine, I get it, you like pillows.
•   <strong>Goldfish:</strong> Why? Just why?
•   <strong>Taiwan + Tower:</strong> I didn't think it could get more cringy... I was wrong.
•   <strong>Taiwan + Tower:</strong> The cringe is unbearable.
•   <strong>Orange Thing:</strong> I thought you were special but you're just boring.
•   <strong>Taiwan + Tower:</strong> I'm starting to feel sorry for you.
•   <strong>Bow thingy:</strong> I could see this getting offensive pretty quick.
•   <strong>Taiwan + Tower:</strong> This profile picture makes me want to leave the internet.
•   <strong>Coin:</strong> Are you okay?
•   <strong>Orange Thing:</strong> Give it up! Find something else!</div>
