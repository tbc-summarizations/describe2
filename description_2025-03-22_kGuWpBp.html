  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those songs:

1.  <strong>I Want Wind To Blow:</strong> 6/10. Bit too long for its own good. Starts strong but loses steam.
2.  <strong>The Glow, Pt. 2:</strong> 9/10. A classic. Melodic, haunting, great build-up.
3.  <strong>The Moon:</strong> 7/10. Moody and atmospheric. Good, but not a standout.
4.  <strong>Headless Horseman:</strong> 5/10. A bit cheesy, honestly. Sounds like a Tim Burton soundtrack reject.
5.  <strong>My Roots Are Strong and Deep:</strong> 8/10. Simple, but effective. Gets stuck in your head.
6.  <strong>Instrumental:</strong> 4/10. Skips quickly. Pointless if it doesn't build into something.
7.  <strong>The Mansion:</strong> 6/10. Decent storytelling, but drags a bit.
8.  <strong>\[untitled]:</strong> 3/10. Tells me all I need to know from it's title. Not even worth a title.
9.  <strong>(Something):</strong> 5/10. Could be anything really, who knows.
10. <strong>I'll Not Contain You:</strong> 7/10. Gets to the point and it's pretty good.
11. <strong>The Gleam, Pt. 2:</strong> 5/10. A bit boring and feels like it's missing something.
12. <strong>Map:</strong> 8/10. Very enjoyable. Has substance and feels complete.
13. <strong>You'll Be In the Air:</strong> 6/10. Slightly too cheerful for my taste, but catchy.
14. <strong>I Want To Be Cold:</strong> 5/10. Pretty boring to be honest.
15. <strong>I Am Bored:</strong> 4/10. Makes sense that they are.
16. <strong>I Felt My Size:</strong> 7/10. Pretty solid and gives a decent insight.
17. <strong>Instrumental:</strong> 6/10. Still pretty boring but good enough.
18. <strong>I Felt Your Shape:</strong> 7/10. Like it as the title actually gives an insight to the music.
19. <strong>Samurai Sword:</strong> 8/10. Great and I can tell that's something the creator puts effort into.
20. <strong>My Warm Blood:</strong> 9/10. Extremely good but a bit on the long side.

There you have it. No holds barred.</div>
