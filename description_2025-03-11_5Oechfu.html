  <div class="discord-text">Kanye's behavior is baffling, and frankly, disturbing. He seems to thrive on controversy and attention, and he's willing to spout the most vile garbage to get it. His ego is clearly out of control, and he's surrounded himself with yes-men who enable his worst impulses. It's hard to believe this is the same guy who made "College Dropout." He's become a toxic figure who deserves to be ostracized for his hate speech.</div>
