  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear these UCL semi-final results apart:

<strong>Arsenal vs. PSG:</strong> Arsenal, oh Arsenal. You went out like wet cardboard against a slightly better team. 1-3 on aggregate? Embarrassing. Your attack was toothless, your defense more porous than Swiss cheese. You bottled it on the big stage once again, proving you're still the same old Arsenal â€“ all promise, no delivery. Go back to London and dream about Wenger's glory days, because this current squad is a joke.

<strong>Barcelona vs. Inter Milan:</strong> This one's a proper comedy show. Barcelona, you managed to lose even after scoring six goals? That takes a special kind of incompetence. Your defense couldn't handle Inter's attack, and your midfield was overrun. And Inter Milan, you barely scraped through in extra time. You were lucky Barcelona were so terrible. Enjoy your victory, but don't get cocky, because you're just slightly less bad than Barca.</div>
