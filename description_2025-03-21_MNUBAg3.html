  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest assessment of those countries' importance to the world, rated on a scale of 1 to 10:

•   <strong>Greece 🇬🇷:</strong> 6/10. Its ancient history is a bedrock of Western civilization, but its current economic and political influence is relatively limited.

•   <strong>Egypt 🇪🇬:</strong> 7/10. Its strategic location, control of the Suez Canal, and cultural influence in the Arab world make it important. However, its internal stability is a persistent concern.

•   <strong>England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿:</strong> 8/10. As part of the UK, it holds a significant place in global finance, culture, and politics. However, its global power is fading compared to its historical peak.

•   <strong>Bosnia 🇧🇦:</strong> 3/10. Its geopolitical importance is mostly regional. Its internal divisions and economic struggles limit its broader impact.

•   <strong>Malaysia 🇲🇾:</strong> 6/10. A growing economy and strategic location in Southeast Asia give it regional importance. However, its global impact remains moderate.

•   <strong>Peru 🇵🇪:</strong> 4/10. Its natural resources and biodiversity are significant, but its political instability and economic challenges limit its influence.

•   <strong>Poland 🇵🇱:</strong> 7/10. A key player in Eastern Europe, its strong economy and geopolitical position within the EU and NATO make it significant.

•   <strong>Kazakhstan 🇰🇿:</strong> 5/10. Its vast size, natural resources (especially oil), and strategic location between Russia and China give it regional importance, but its global influence is limited.

•   <strong>Estonia 🇪🇪:</strong> 4/10. Its digital innovation and strong ties to the EU give it a small but notable role in the tech world.

•   <strong>Serbia 🇷🇸:</strong> 4/10. Its strategic location in the Balkans and historical ties to Russia give it some regional importance, but its internal issues limit its broader impact.</div>
