  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">OMAGUH WATAFUK BRO IS THAT A... BIOS update failing? Seriously? Are we back in 2005? Is this what passes for cutting-edge technology in your world, you z端h-ass, l端h-brained goof? I've seen more advanced user interfaces on a goddamn calculator, cuh.

First of all, "UPDATEBIOS.exe"? What, were you too lazy to give it a more descriptive name? Did you just smash your face into the keyboard and go, "Yeah, that'll do, pruh." It's about as informative as calling a car "Vehicle.exe".

And that error message? "This application could not be started." No shit, Sherlock! I mean, no DUH! That's why it's popping up in my face like an unwanted boner! Do you think I'm some kinda goonin idiot who can't read between the lines? Tell me <em>why</em> it couldn't start, you morons! Give me some actual information, not some vague, "something went wrong" bullshit. This is the kinda message you get when your mom tells you to take out the trash and you just shrug and say "can't." Like, tell me the damn trash can is chained down!

And then they have the gaul to ask me, "Do you want to view information about this issue?" OMAGUH, DO I EVER! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? Is that even a serious question, you dumb fucks? I'm staring at an error message, which means something went wrong, and you're asking if I want to know more? You're like a doctor asking a patient with a broken leg if they'd like to hear about potential treatment options. What the hell else would they want, cuh?

And those buttons, "Yes" and "No"... oh, the pinnacle of interface design. You really went all-out with the creativity there, didn't you? You could've at least changed the font to Comic Sans or something to make it more exciting, you know, add a little pizzazz.

And the icon? A big red "X"? Ooh, so intimidating! It's like you're trying to scare me into fixing the problem myself, you bunch of l端h-brained fucks. I almost shit my pants! It's so ominous, like a warning sign for a nuclear meltdown, only instead of radiation, it's just the soul-crushing realization that I have to spend the next hour Googling obscure error codes.

It's like that time I tried to install this pirated software, right? I thought I was getting a free copy of Photoshop, but instead, I got a virus that turned my desktop background into a picture of a goatse. And then my computer started speaking in tongues, and I swear to God, the monitor started oozing green slime. I had to call my cousin, who's like, a super-genius computer nerd, and even he couldn't figure it out for a week. I swear to God, I'm starting to think this BIOS update error is going to be even worse than that goatse incident.

This whole thing just reeks of incompetence, bruh. It's like the programmer responsible for this just gave up halfway through and said, "Screw it, let's just throw up some error message and call it a day." I bet they got their degree from some online college that specializes in teaching people how to code in COBOL. 

Honestly, I'd have a better chance of fixing this problem by sacrificing a goat to the computer gods or consulting a Ouija board.

The sheer audacity to release something so half-assed is astounding. Are you trying to give me an aneurysm, you cuh-z端hs? I swear, if I ever meet the person responsible for this, I'm going to... well, I don't know what I'm going to do, but it won't be pretty. Probably just a stern talking to, because violence is wrong and I'm a civilized individual. But still, I'll be really, really angry.

In conclusion, this error message is a steaming pile of dogshit, and the person who created it should be forced to spend the rest of their days writing documentation for Windows Vista. And may their keyboard forever be sticky with spilled soda.</div>
