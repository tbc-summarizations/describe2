  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how I see these UCL semi-finals going down, with the brutality you requested:

<strong>Fulham vs. Celtic</strong>

•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> Fulham 5 - 2 Celtic (Aggregate)

•   <strong>Brutal Honesty:</strong> Fulham is going to dismantle Celtic. Celtic might put up a fight in the first leg at Celtic Park with their fans and everything, but Fulham's quality in midfield and their ruthless finishing will be too much for the Scottish side to handle. Expect a comfortable win for Fulham at Craven Cottage.

<strong>LASK vs. AZ</strong>

•   <strong>Prediction:</strong> LASK 1 - 3 AZ (Aggregate)
•   <strong>Brutal Honesty:</strong> LASK is a decent team, but AZ is just better. AZ have been building a strong squad for a long time and are ready to challenge for titles. The Dutch side have more creativity, better coaching, and their players have a level of cunningness that LASK just cannot match. They'll control both legs, and LASK's hopes are a joke at best.</div>
