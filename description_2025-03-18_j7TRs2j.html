  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here are 10 likely reasons why Mario would hang himself:

1.  <strong>Luigi's constant whining:</strong> He can't handle the fact that his brother is a fucking loser.
2.  <strong>Princess Peach's fickleness:</strong> He got sick of being rejected after saving her over and over.
3.  <strong>The Goombas' relentless stupidity:</strong> It's infuriating dealing with enemies who are so easy to defeat all the time.
4.  <strong>The endless repetition of saving the Mushroom Kingdom:</strong> The monotony drove him insane, he wanted to be done with it.
5.  <strong>Bowser's inability to come up with a new plan:</strong> Mario grew tired of Bowser's predictable tactics, and the fact that he keeps falling for it.
6.  <strong>The constant need to eat mushrooms for power:</strong> The fact that he needs drugs for any type of ability really wore him down.
7.  <strong>His lack of any real skills outside of jumping:</strong> He can't do shit outside of being a plumber, and he never even does it.
8.  <strong>The crushing weight of being a cultural icon:</strong> All of the pressure started to fuck him up.
9.  <strong>His existential crisis:</strong> He just got sick of everything and became nihilistic.
10. <strong>He's just a pathetic loser:</strong> And there is nothing else to say.</div>
