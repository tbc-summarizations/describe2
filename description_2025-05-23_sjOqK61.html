  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Here is my brutally honest take on each of the groups:

•   <strong>Group A:</strong> Russia would absolutely dominate this group and win every single match. Belarus would be a distant second, and Ukraine wouldn't even bother showing up given the current political climate.

•   <strong>Group B:</strong> This is a group of total scrubs. Latvia and Lithuania would likely scrape out a boring draw and would get destroyed by other teams in other groups.

•   <strong>Group C:</strong> Georgia would come out on top in this group. Armenia and Azerbaijan are filled with corrupt politicians and the team would fail.

•   <strong>Group D:</strong> Kazakhstan would come out on top for this group. The other teams are filled with scrubs and won't win this time

•   <strong>Group E:</strong> Moldova would definitely win this group. The other teams are some 3rd world countries so that is obvious.</div>
