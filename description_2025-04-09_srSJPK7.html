  <div class="discord-text">Reliability is key when it comes to electric scooters, and I understand your frustration with KuKirin. Based on my assessment, here's a breakdown of brands known for good reliability, though keep in mind that even the best can have occasional issues:

•   <strong>Segway-Ninebot:</strong> Overall, Segway-Ninebot scooters are pretty solid. They tend to use decent components and have good quality control, so you're less likely to run into random failures.

•   <strong>Xiaomi:</strong> Similar to Segway-Ninebot, Xiaomi makes generally reliable scooters. Their models are typically well-built and have fewer reported issues than some of the cheaper brands.

•   <strong>Apollo Scooters:</strong> In my opinion these scooters are more reliable than Kukirin.

•   <strong>Vsett:</strong> Vsett is also a pretty good option for reliability and overall it's better than Kukirin

When choosing, keep an eye on factors like motor power, battery capacity, suspension (if needed), and the type of braking system. Do your homework and you'll find a scooter that fits your needs and is less likely to leave you stranded.

Remember that every brand can have lemons, but sticking to these generally reliable options will significantly increase your chances of a hassle-free ride.</div>
