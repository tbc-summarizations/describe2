  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal truth about this Belgium squad, player by player, the overall rating, and their chances in major tournaments:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong>
•   Thibaut Courtois: 9.5 - World-class, saves games single-handedly.
•   Matz Sels: 5 - Decent backup, nothing special.
•   Senne Lammens: 3 - Untested, likely a future prospect.

•   <strong>Defenders:</strong>
•   Thomas Meunier: 6 - Past his prime, reliable but lacks pace.
•   Timothy Castagne: 7 - Solid, versatile, but not a game-changer.
•   Wout Faes: 6.5 - Physical, but prone to errors.
•   Arthur Theate: 6 - Average, needs improvement.
•   Zeno Debast: 5 - Young, potential, but raw.
•   Maxim De Cuyper: 4 - Lacks experience, probably not ready for the big stage.
•   Ameen Al-Dakhil: 4 - Unknown quantity, likely a squad filler.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   Kevin De Bruyne: 9.5 - One of the best in the world, but can he carry the team?
•   Hans Vanaken: 6 - Too slow for international level, lacks dynamism.
•   Youri Tielemans: 6.5 - Inconsistent, flashes of brilliance, but not reliable.
•   Axel Witsel: 5 - Old, slow, and past his best.
•   Orel Mangala: 6 - Average, decent defensively, but limited going forward.
•   Charles De Ketelaere: 6 - Needs to step up, potential is there but hasn't shown it consistently.
•   Amadou Onana: 7 - Promising, athletic, but still developing.

•   <strong>Attackers:</strong>
•   Romelu Lukaku: 7 - Goalscorer, but relies on service and prone to disappearing in big games.
•   Michy Batshuayi: 5 - Decent backup, but not a top-tier striker.
•   Leandro Trossard: 7.5 - Versatile, can score goals, but not a consistent starter.
•   Yannick Carrasco: 6.5 - Tricky, but lacks end product.
•   Jeremy Doku: 7.5 - Exciting, direct, but needs to improve his decision-making.
•   Lois Openda: 7 - Promising, quick, but unproven at the highest level.

<strong>Overall Squad Rating: 6.8/10</strong>

This squad is a mixed bag. They have world-class players in Courtois and De Bruyne, but the defense is aging and lacks pace, while the midfield is inconsistent. The attack has potential, but relies heavily on Lukaku being in form.

<strong>Chances of Winning Major Tournaments:</strong>

•   <strong>World Cup:</strong> 5% - Too many weaknesses, unlikely to go far.
•   <strong>Euros:</strong> 10% - Slightly better chance, but still not a top contender.
•   <strong>Nations League:</strong> 15% - Decent chance, but depends on the form of key players and luck.

<strong>Summary:</strong>

This Belgium squad is a far cry from the "golden generation" that failed to deliver. They have individual quality, but the team as a whole is unbalanced, aging, and lacks the tactical flexibility to compete with the very best. Expectation should be tempered.</div>
