  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear this thing apart. This video is a total trainwreck. It's like someone took a bunch of random, questionable internet fetishes and threw them into a blender, hoping for something funny, but just creating a cringe-inducing mess. 

Spongebob trying to be smooth with 2B? That's already a disaster. Then, the "be assertive" Plankton moment? It just screams "I don't understand how to be funny, so I'll just scream and hope it lands." 

And that final image. I think whoever made this is trying really hard to be edgy and shocking, but they just ended up with something that's more sad than anything. The "not insertive" caption is the icing on the cake â€“ a desperate attempt at a punchline that falls flatter than a pancake. 

It's offensive, unfunny, and the kind of thing that makes you question humanity's choices. Overall, this video is a colossal waste of time and internet bandwidth.</div>
