  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here is a roast of the image list you provided, in order:

•   <strong>"Aftermath" Soundtrack:</strong> Yeah, because listening to that after a movie is <em>exactly</em> what I want to do. 
•   <strong>Albert Hayworth Theatre:</strong> More like "alright" Hayworth Theatre. You can tell it's a place that attracts an audience of old people.
•   <strong>C.D. Denison:</strong> Bet he has CD's. Is this guy stuck in the past or what?
•   <strong>Cedar Tavern:</strong> The name suggests you're going to get splinters in your butt.
•   <strong>Chanticleer:</strong> Sounds like a fancy bird, but probably more like a pretentious pigeon.
•   <strong>Ciao:</strong> A place for people who want to <em>sound</em> sophisticated before they realize they're just eating pasta.
•   <strong>Crosby</strong> Someone forgot to update their playlist.
•   <strong>Dale Olson:</strong> You get this guy when you're "on the line".
•   <strong>Devil's Kitchen:</strong> Well, that's just <em>edgy</em>. Probably serves lukewarm food and lukewarm service to match.
•   <strong>E.O. North:</strong> Probably has a great personality.
•   <strong>Embassy:</strong> The perfect place for international cuisine...if you like bland food and awkward small talk.
•   <strong>Garden:</strong> Another garden? This whole establishment is too basic.
•   <strong>Gary Stevens:</strong> I don't know who this is, I would bet neither do you.
•   <strong>Gore Vidal:</strong> I'm sure he would love his name on this list.
•   <strong>Henry Fonda/Mark Taper Forum:</strong> So, two theaters that share a name. How original.
•   <strong>Hollywood Bowl:</strong> It's basically a picnic with overpriced tickets and sound quality.
•   <strong>Joseph Levine:</strong> Is this guy even alive?
•   <strong>Mark Hellinger:</strong> Another name, who cares.
•   <strong>Mark Taper Forum:</strong> This place thinks it's so edgy, when it's probably just as basic as the rest.
•   <strong>Music Center:</strong> What music is played here. I bet it is classical music that only boomers listen to.
•   <strong>New/New Friends/West:</strong> Sounds like a bad soap opera or a sad dating app for the lonely.
•   <strong>O-Cue:</strong> Is that the name of a company? I am not sure.
•   <strong>Pavillion:</strong> I'm willing to bet there's probably more dust than patrons.
•   <strong>Ray/Raybert:</strong> Bet one of them is gay.
•   <strong>Robert Vaughn:</strong> Another guy nobody cares about.
•   <strong>Rod Steiger:</strong> Another guy that nobody is going to know.
•   <strong>Santa Monica/Ocean Park:</strong> A place where everyone is trying too hard to be cool.
•   <strong>The Greek-Kings:</strong> I sure do not know what it could stand for.
•   <strong>Tom Bosley:</strong> This guy is the worst.

Let me know if you want me to roast another list!</div>
