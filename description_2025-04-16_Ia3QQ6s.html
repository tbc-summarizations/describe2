  <h1>Description for BattleForNiggas3.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my take on that "Evil Venus" character from this object show.

<strong>General Information:</strong>

Based on what I can see, Evil Venus is a contestant in this "Battle for Nirrous" thing. It seems to be a competition where different objects are voted out. That's about all I can gather on the basic details of this character's existence.

<strong>External Appearance:</strong>

Weâ€™ve got images of various objects. In the video the contestants are; [A] Aldi, [B] Goblin, [C] Cow, [D] What if the beatles never existed, [E] professorpercocoet's tweet, [F] Cold Cow, [G] Strawberry, [H] Cat, [I] Kanye West, [J] Thats It, [K] Face, and Black Hole is eliminated with a score of 1932/568 vs. the Cold Cow. The one named Evil Venus is missing.

<strong>Personality:</strong>

This show is weird, not gonna lie. It is not possible to decide what is the object's personality if there are any objects named Evil Venus, and they don't interact with the object or talk.

<strong>Abilities:</strong>

If there are no objects named Evil Venus, it has the ability to just be a random name.

<strong>Rating:</strong>

Honestly, this whole thing is a train wreck, the show is pretty much just random objects with text and no logical connections, no explanation for the random additions and its overall tone is just weird. My rating of Evil Venus, even if it doesn't exist, and this whole show is a resounding 0/10. I can't even pretend to be impressed with anything in here.</div>
