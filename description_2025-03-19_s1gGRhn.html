  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how you handle Kanye if he's waving a gun around like it's a Yeezy sample:

1.  <strong>The "I Love Your Work" Ploy:</strong> Start gushing about <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em>. Tell him it's your go-to album for moping over exes or existential dread. Maybe even drop a line about how it influenced your own (non-existent) music career. Everyone loves an ego stroke.

2.  <strong>The "Deeply Concerned Friend" Act:</strong> Say something like, "Kanye, my man, are you okay? You seem a little... off. Is Kim still making you sleep on the couch?" Appeal to his sense of vulnerability.

3.  <strong>The "Religious Intervention":</strong> Casually mention that you're on a pilgrimage to find the real meaning of life through the lens of Christian ideology. Start quoting random Bible verses. The sheer absurdity might distract him.

4.  <strong>The "Fashion Critique":</strong> Look him dead in the eye and say, "Kanye, that outfit is... questionable. Are you sure you want to be seen in public like that?" If there's one thing he's sensitive about, it's his fashion sense.

5.  <strong>The "Reverse Psychology":</strong> Say, "Go ahead, shoot me. I dare you. It'll be great publicity for my mixtape." Make him question his motives.

And if all else fails, just run. Seriously, run. Your safety is more important than trying to reason with someone who's clearly lost their marbles.</div>
