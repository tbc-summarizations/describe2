  <h1>Description for videoplayback.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because we're going to tear this atrocity apart, piece by putrid piece. 

First off, let's address the elephant in the room. That group photo looks like a fever dream spawned from a dumpster fire behind a Chuck E. Cheese. You've got Fredbear looking like he just realized his entire existence is a thinly veiled marketing ploy, Joy looking like she's seconds away from a manic breakdown, and what the hell is that monster in the back? Did someone give a purple potato a face and antlers? As for Garfield, he looks like he’s about to die any second, and the rest I can’t even explain. 

Then we have that music. Is that supposed to be singing? It sounds like a choir of constipated cats gargling gravel. And the lyrics? "Story of Undertale..." ground-breaking, Pulitzer-worthy stuff right there, I’m sure. 

The animation that follows is even worse. What’s up with Peter Griffin falling from the light, looking like he’s about to get canceled for saying the N word to a character who looks like a voodoo doll? It’s like someone threw every cartoon character into a blender and hit "liquefy."

Oh, and Inspector Gadget shows up looking like he just crawled out of a crypt and is about to get a heart attack from some angry orange. No wonder the guy’s always getting into trouble, he looks like he’s already halfway to the grave. 

And who invited Parappa the Rapper to this party? He looks like a sad, yellow conehead trying to hide from his parental responsibilities. I don't even want to discuss the one-dimensional Mr. Game &amp; Watch walking around. 

Next is the song: I fell from the light, talk or should I fight, monster gender sign. Like what even does that mean? You want us to be transphobic now too?

Moving on, we’ve got Peter Griffin again, hugging a voodoo doll like it's the only thing keeping him from facing his inevitable divorce. Then there's that random kid with a mole who has a bright idea about what to do. Then comes the man who has “Got Nutz”. 

Oh, and good old Charlie is here! He will try to skip but needs more limbs.

And how about the absolute genius who thought it would be funny to have Darwin from "The Amazing World of Gumball" contemplate passive resistance versus straight-up violence? "Should I be a pacifist, or should I use my fists?" Oh, the depth! The nuance! I'm weeping.

Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, the song transitions into a pathetic attempt at EDM and some low-budget version of Adventure Time.

Then comes Monica, trying to lure in George Bush with a smile to hurt him with her rabbit. But then comes Caillou with sunglasses who murders some random guy. How does that even happen?

The character in black who has Jerk written on his T-Shirt, can’t believe he has a headache and needs to approach ice block. I swear to God if you are trying to be homophobic and you have a problem that a guy can just enjoy other men…

Let's not forget the "I'm on a tidal wave and I got a taste, I want to light up my monster place!" I am already struggling to write more insults for that line. 

After that, there’s that blue teddy bear with a safari hat who’s about to beat up that Goomba? What did the Goomba do to warrant this?

And how about a Minion? Oh, I love Minions they are so cute! But of course, you have to make them evil.

Lastly, if any of you ever make a video like this again I am going to send a pipe bomb to your house. Thank you and goodbye.</div>
