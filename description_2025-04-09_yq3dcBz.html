  <div class="discord-text">Given your preference for good suspension and a dual motor, here are some off-road electric scooters I'd recommend:

<strong>High-End Performance:</strong>

•   <strong>Dualtron Ultra 2:</strong> This scooter is an absolute beast. It's renowned for its incredible power, rugged construction, and sophisticated suspension system. It can handle almost any terrain.

•   <strong>Kaabo Wolf Warrior 11:</strong> Another popular choice, the Wolf Warrior 11 is known for its powerful dual motors and robust build. It offers excellent suspension and is designed to tackle tough off-road conditions.

•   <strong>NAMI BURN-E 2 MAX:</strong> If you want to spend the money, this is your top pick. It has front and rear adjustable coil suspension which is better than air suspension. Also, it's a 72v making it go faster than competitors on the market.

<strong>Mid-Range Options:</strong>

•   <strong>Apollo Pro:</strong> Great coil suspension for it's price, also has dual motor and goes about 40mph, not bad!

<strong>Important Considerations:</strong>

•   <strong>Budget:</strong> Off-road electric scooters can be quite expensive. Determine your budget before diving into the options.
•   <strong>Weight:</strong> These scooters are heavy. Consider whether you'll need to lift it into a car or carry it up stairs.
•   <strong>Terrain:</strong> Think about the type of off-road riding you'll be doing. Some scooters are better suited for rough terrain than others.
•   <strong>Safety Gear:</strong> Always wear appropriate safety gear, including a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads.

These are my honest recommendations based on power, suspension quality, and overall off-road capabilities. Hope this helps you find the perfect off-road scooter!</div>
